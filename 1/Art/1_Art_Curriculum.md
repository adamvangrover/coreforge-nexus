# Grade 1 Art Curriculum: Exploring and Creating

## I. Overview and Alignment
*   **Subject Description:** First-grade art builds upon kindergarten experiences, encouraging students to further explore art materials, techniques, and concepts. Students will develop their skills in drawing, painting, collage, and basic sculpture, while also learning about art elements like line, shape, color, and texture. They will begin to make more intentional choices in their artwork and discuss their own and others' creations.
*   **Learning Standards Addressed (Example - Aligned with National Core Arts Standards - Visual Arts - Grade 1):**
    *   **Creating (VA:Cr):**
        *   VA:Cr1.1.1: Engage collaboratively in exploration and imaginative play with materials.
        *   VA:Cr1.2.1: Use observation and investigation in preparation for making a work of art.
        *   VA:Cr2.1.1: Through experimentation, build skills in various art-making techniques and approaches using various media.

        *   Students will be able to mix primary colors to create secondary colors.
        *   Students will be able to identify and use warm and cool colors in their artwork.
    *   Essential Questions: What happens when we mix colors? How can colors make us feel? How do artists use warm and cool colors?
*   **Unit 4: Feeling Textures**
    *   Key Concepts: Identifying and describing different textures (smooth, rough, bumpy, soft, fuzzy, prickly). Creating actual texture (how something really feels) and visual texture (how something looks like it feels) in artwork using various materials and techniques (e.g., collage, rubbings, paint techniques).
    *   Learning Objectives:
        *   Students will be able to describe various textures using appropriate vocabulary.
        *   Students will be able to create actual texture in a collage.
        *   Students will be able to create visual texture in a drawing or painting.

## III. Instructional Strategies & Resources
*   **Key Pedagogical Approaches:** Direct instruction for techniques, guided practice, studio-based exploration, demonstrations, viewing and discussing art (age-appropriate examples), collaborative art projects, learning centers.
*   **Potential Interdisciplinary Connections:**
    *   Language Arts: Illustrating stories, creating visual narratives, describing artwork using art vocabulary.
    *   Math: Identifying shapes, creating patterns, symmetry (introduction).
    *   Science: Observing natural objects for drawing, color mixing, textures in nature.
    *   Social Studies: Art from different cultures, art that tells historical stories (simplified).
*   **Ideas for Supplemental Materials & Technology Integration:**
    *   Materials: Drawing paper, construction paper, crayons, markers, tempera paint, watercolors, paintbrushes, scissors, glue, collage materials (yarn, fabric scraps, tissue paper, buttons, natural materials), oil pastels, modeling clay or playdough.
    *   Technology: Interactive whiteboard for displaying famous artworks or demonstrating techniques. Simple drawing apps on tablets for exploration (optional, focus on hands-on). Short videos showing artists at work or art from different cultures.

## IV. Assessment Strategies
*   **Formative Assessments:**
    *   Observation of students' use of materials and techniques during art-making.
    *   Class critiques/discussions where students talk about their artwork and the choices they made (using simple art vocabulary).
    *   Sketchbook entries or practice sheets showing skill development.
    *   "Exit tickets" with a simple question or task (e.g., "Draw a wavy line," "Name one primary color").
*   **Summative Assessments:**
    *   Completed art projects that demonstrate understanding of unit concepts (e.g., a painting using secondary colors, a textured collage, an observational drawing).
    *   A portfolio of selected artworks showing growth throughout the year.
    *   Ability to verbally identify and describe key art elements (line, shape, color, texture) in artworks.
*   **Accommodations & Modifications (IDEA/504):**
    *   Adapted art tools (e.g., larger grip brushes, spring-loaded scissors, pencil grips).
    *   Pre-drawn outlines or stencils for some activities.
    *   Choice of media or subject matter within project guidelines.
    *   Visual step-by-step instructions for projects.
    *   Additional time for completing projects.
*   **ELL Support Strategies:**
    *   Visual vocabulary charts for art terms, tools, and concepts.
    *   Demonstrations with minimal verbal instruction, emphasizing visual learning.
    *   Sentence frames for discussing art ("I used ____ lines," "This color makes me feel ____").
    *   Pairing with supportive peers who can assist with language.
    *   Allowing students to express understanding through their artwork even if verbal skills are limited.
