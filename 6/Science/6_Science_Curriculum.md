# Grade 6 Science Curriculum: Exploring the Natural World

## I. Overview and Alignment
*   **Subject Description:** Sixth-grade science typically marks a transition to more discipline-specific studies, often focusing on Earth Science, Life Science, and Physical Science fundamentals. Students will engage in inquiry-based investigations, develop skills in scientific reasoning and argumentation, and apply scientific knowledge to real-world phenomena. Emphasis is on understanding systems, models, and the interconnectedness of scientific concepts.
*   **Learning Standards Addressed (Example - Aligned with Next Generation Science Standards - Middle School):**
    *   **MS-ESS1 Earth's Place in the Universe:** (e.g., Patterns of apparent motion of the sun, moon, and stars; Earth-sun-moon system; Scale and properties of objects in the solar system).
    *   **MS-ESS2 Earth's Systems:** (e.g., Earth's materials and systems; Plate tectonics and large-scale system interactions; The roles of water in Earth's surface processes).
    *   **MS-LS1 From Molecules to Organisms: Structures and Processes:** (e.g., Cell theory; Organization of matter and energy flow in organisms; Growth and development of organisms).
    *   **MS-PS1 Matter and Its Interactions:** (e.g., Structure and properties of matter; Chemical reactions).
    *   **MS-PS2 Motion and Stability: Forces and Interactions:** (e.g., Forces and motion; Types of interactions).
    *   **MS-ETS1 Engineering Design:** (Define problems, design solutions, optimize solutions).
*   **Federal Mandate Considerations:** ESSA's focus on STEM education, critical thinking, and inquiry-based learning.
*   **Statutory Instructional Mandates Integrated:** (If applicable, e.g., specific state requirements for lab safety instruction, environmental education).

    *   Essential Questions: Why does the moon appear to change shape? What causes day, night, and the seasons? What keeps planets in orbit?
*   **Unit 3: Structure and Function of Living Organisms**
    *   Key Concepts: Cell theory (cells as the basic unit of life). Plant and animal cell structures and functions (organelles). Levels of organization (cells, tissues, organs, organ systems, organism). Basic life processes (photosynthesis, respiration - conceptual).
    *   Learning Objectives (Example):
        *   Students will be able to conduct an investigation to provide evidence that living things are made of cells; either one cell or many different numbers and types of cells (MS-LS1-1).
        *   Students will be able to develop and use a model to describe the function of a cell as a whole and ways parts of cells contribute to the function (MS-LS1-2).
        *   Students will be able to use argument supported by evidence for how the body is a system of interacting subsystems composed of groups of cells (MS-LS1-3).
    *   Essential Questions: What are all living things made of? How do cells work? How do different parts of an organism work together?
*   **Unit 4: Matter and Its Interactions**
    *   Key Concepts: Properties of matter (mass, volume, density). States of matter (solid, liquid, gas) and phase changes. Atoms and molecules (basic introduction). Mixtures and solutions. Introduction to chemical reactions (observing changes, e.g., color change, gas production). Conservation of mass (conceptual).
    *   Learning Objectives (Example):
        *   Students will be able to develop models to describe the atomic composition of simple molecules and extended structures (MS-PS1-1).
        *   Students will be able to analyze and interpret data on the properties of substances before and after the substances interact to determine if a chemical reaction has occurred (MS-PS1-2).
        *   Students will be able to gather and make sense of information to describe that synthetic materials come from natural resources and impact society (MS-PS1-3).
    *   Essential Questions: What is everything made of? How can matter change from one form to another? How do we know if a new substance has been formed?
*   **Unit 5: Forces and Motion**
    *   Key Concepts: Types of forces (gravity, friction, applied force). Balanced and unbalanced forces. Newton's First Law (inertia - conceptual). Relationship between force, mass, and acceleration (qualitative). Simple machines as force modifiers (lever, inclined plane - examples).

    *   Pre-teaching key vocabulary.
