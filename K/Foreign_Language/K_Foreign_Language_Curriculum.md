# Kindergarten Foreign Language Curriculum: Playful Introduction to [Target Language - e.g., Spanish]

**Note:** This curriculum outline uses "[Target Language]" as a placeholder. Replace it with the specific language being taught (e.g., Spanish, French, Mandarin). For examples, Spanish will be used. ¡Hola!

## I. Overview and Alignment
*   **Subject Description:** Kindergarten Foreign Language introduces young children to a new language and culture through engaging, playful, and age-appropriate activities. The focus is on oral language development (listening and speaking), basic vocabulary acquisition, and fostering a positive attitude towards language learning and cultural diversity. Formal grammar instruction is minimal; immersion and interaction are key.
*   **Learning Standards Addressed (Example - Aligned with ACTFL World-Readiness Standards for Learning Languages - Novice Low/Mid Cans):**

        *   Interpretive Listening: 1.2 (Understand, interpret, and analyze what is heard, read, or viewed on a variety of topics). *K-level: Recognize familiar words and phrases, understand simple directions, identify characters/objects in stories.*
        *   Presentational Speaking: 1.3 (Present information, concepts, and ideas to inform, explain, persuade, and narrate on a variety of topics using appropriate media and adapting to various audiences of listeners, readers, or viewers). *K-level: Name familiar objects, people; recite simple rhymes/songs; introduce self.*

    *   **Comparisons:** 4.1 (Investigate, explain, and reflect on the nature of language through comparisons of the language studied and their own), 4.2 (Investigate, explain, and reflect on the concept of culture through comparisons of the cultures studied and their own). *K-level: Notice some similarities/differences in sounds or words; compare simple cultural routines (e.g., greetings).*
    *   **Communities:** 5.1 (Interact and collaborate in their community and the globalized world both within and beyond the classroom setting), 5.2 (Set goals and reflect on their progress in using languages for enjoyment, enrichment, and advancement). *K-level: Use language for enjoyment in classroom activities; show interest in learning more.*

    *   Math: Counting, identifying shapes, sorting by color in [Target Language].
    *   Language Arts: Listening to stories from [Target Language] cultures (in [Target Language] if simple enough, or in English with key vocabulary).
*   **Ideas for Supplemental Materials & Technology Integration:**
    *   Materials: Flashcards (colors, numbers, family, animals, food), puppets, picture books in [Target Language] or bilingual books, realia (toys, plastic food, clothing items), music CDs or streaming services with children's songs in [Target Language].
    *   Technology: Interactive whiteboard games for vocabulary practice, short, age-appropriate animated videos in [Target Language] (e.g., from vetted YouTube channels like "Little Baby Bum en Español", "Super Simple Español"), language learning apps with a K-level focus (use with caution and teacher guidance).

## IV. Assessment Strategies
*   **Formative Assessments (Primarily Observational and Performance-Based):**
    *   Teacher observation of student participation in songs, games, and activities.
    *   Student response to simple commands and questions in [Target Language] (e.g., "Point to red," "Stand up").
    *   Ability to name objects or pictures shown on flashcards.
    *   Participation in simple dialogues or role-plays.
    *   "Show me" (e.g., "Show me three fingers" - "Muéstrame tres dedos").
*   **Summative Assessments (Informal):**
    *   Simple oral vocabulary recognition (teacher says word, student points to picture, or vice-versa).
    *   Performance of a learned song or rhyme.
    *   Ability to answer simple personal questions (e.g., "¿Cómo te llamas?").
    *   A "portfolio" of drawings where students label items in [Target Language] (teacher can scribe).

    *   Increased use of visuals and gestures.
    *   Peer pairing with a supportive classmate.
