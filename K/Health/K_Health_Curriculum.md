    *   "Thumbs up/thumbs down" for understanding concepts.
*   **Summative Assessments (Informal):**
    *   Simple role-playing scenarios (e.g., what to do if a stranger approaches, how to ask for help).
    *   Creating a class book or poster about a health topic (e.g., "Our Healthy Habits").
    *   Verbally identifying healthy choices in given scenarios.
*   **Accommodations & Modifications (IDEA/504):**
    *   Use of visual schedules and cues.
    *   Breaking down tasks into smaller steps.
    *   Providing choices in how to demonstrate understanding (e.g., drawing vs. telling).
    *   Peer buddies for activities.
    *   Sensory tools or breaks if needed for managing feelings.
