# Kindergarten Language Arts Curriculum: Foundations in Literacy

## I. Overview and Alignment
*   **Subject Description:** Kindergarten Language Arts lays the critical groundwork for literacy. The curriculum focuses on developing oral language skills, phonological awareness, print awareness, letter knowledge, and emergent reading and writing skills. A rich environment of stories, songs, rhymes, and interactive activities fosters a love of language and prepares students for future reading and writing success.

## III. Instructional Strategies & Resources
*   **Key Pedagogical Approaches:** Shared reading, guided reading (small groups), interactive read-alouds, phonics instruction (explicit and systematic), phonological awareness games and activities, print-rich environment (labels, charts, student work displayed), writing workshop (mini-lessons, independent writing, sharing), interactive writing, morning message, literacy centers/stations.
*   **Potential Interdisciplinary Connections:**
    *   All subjects: Vocabulary development, listening comprehension, following directions.
    *   Art: Illustrating stories, creating letter crafts.
    *   Music: Alphabet songs, rhyming songs, songs that tell stories.
    *   Social Studies/Science: Reading informational texts related to themes, writing about what they learned.
*   **Ideas for Supplemental Materials & Technology Integration:**
    *   Materials: Wide variety of children's literature (fiction, non-fiction, poetry, predictable books, decodable readers), chart paper, markers, sentence strips, magnetic letters, letter tiles, individual whiteboards, journals, drawing paper, crayons, pencils, alphabet charts, word walls.
    *   Technology: Interactive whiteboard for modeling writing, displaying texts, phonics games. Educational apps for letter recognition, phonics, and sight words (e.g., Starfall, ABCmouse - teacher-guided). Audiobooks for listening centers. Document camera for sharing student work or books.

## IV. Assessment Strategies
*   **Formative Assessments:**
    *   Teacher observation during whole group, small group, and center activities.
    *   Anecdotal records of student participation, comments, and skill demonstration.
    *   Checklists for letter recognition, sound identification, sight word knowledge.
    *   Running records (simplified for emergent readers).
    *   Student work samples (drawings, emergent writing, letter formation practice).
    *   Quick phonological awareness checks (e.g., "Do 'cat' and 'hat' rhyme?").
*   **Summative Assessments (Often Performance-Based):**
    *   Letter/Sound identification assessments (e.g., DIBELS, PALS, or teacher-created).
    *   Sight word recognition checks.
    *   Concepts of print assessment (pointing to front of book, identifying a word, etc.).
    *   Simple dictation (writing letters or simple CVC words).
    *   Retelling of a familiar story.
    *   A portfolio of writing samples showing growth.
*   **Accommodations & Modifications (IDEA/504):**
    *   Multi-sensory approaches to learning letters and sounds (sand trays, playdough letters, tactile letters).
    *   Visual aids (picture cues for sounds, highlighted text).
    *   Preferential seating.
    *   Reduced number of items for practice or assessment.
    *   Use of assistive technology (e.g., speech-to-text for dictation if appropriate, though focus is on emergent writing).
    *   Small group or one-on-one instruction for targeted skills.
*   **ELL Support Strategies:**
    *   Extensive use of visuals, realia, and gestures.
    *   Pairing with bilingual peers.
    *   Explicitly teaching English phonemes that may not exist in their L1.
    *   Building background knowledge before reading texts.
    *   Allowing students to use their L1 to clarify understanding initially.
    *   Sentence frames for discussions and writing.
    *   Using cognates if applicable.
