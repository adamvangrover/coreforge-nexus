# Kindergarten Mathematics Curriculum: Discovering Numbers and Shapes

## I. Overview and Alignment
*   **Subject Description:** Kindergarten mathematics provides the foundational experiences that help children develop an understanding of numbers, shapes, measurement, and basic problem-solving. The curriculum emphasizes hands-on activities, exploration, and developing number sense through counting, comparing, and representing quantities. Geometric reasoning begins with identifying and describing shapes.
*   **Learning Standards Addressed (Example - Aligned with Common Core State Standards for Mathematics - Kindergarten):**
    *   **Counting and Cardinality (K.CC):** Know number names and the count sequence (1-3). Count to tell the number of objects (4-5). Compare numbers (6-7).
    *   **Operations and Algebraic Thinking (K.OA):** Understand addition as putting together and adding to, and understand subtraction as taking apart and taking from (1-5).
    *   **Number and Operations in Base Ten (K.NBT):** Work with numbers 11-19 to gain foundations for place value (1).
    *   **Measurement and Data (K.MD):** Describe and compare measurable attributes (1-2). Classify objects and count the number of objects in categories (3).
    *   **Geometry (K.G):** Identify and describe shapes (squares, circles, triangles, rectangles, hexagons, cubes, cones, cylinders, and spheres) (1-3). Analyze, compare, create, and compose shapes (4-6).
*   **Federal Mandate Considerations:** Focus on early numeracy skills as critical for future academic success and STEM readiness.
*   **Statutory Instructional Mandates Integrated:** (If applicable, e.g., specific requirements for math manipulatives, early intervention programs for math).

## II. Core Concepts / Units

*   **Unit 1: Counting and Numbers 0-5**
    *   Key Concepts: Rote counting to 10 (or higher). One-to-one correspondence when counting objects up to 5. Understanding that the last number said tells the number of objects counted (cardinality). Recognizing and writing numerals 0-5. Comparing sets of objects up to 5 (more than, less than, same as).
    *   Learning Objectives:
        *   Students will be able to count to [target, e.g., 20] by ones (K.CC.A.1).
        *   Students will be able to count forward beginning from a given number within the known sequence (instead of having to begin at 1) (K.CC.A.2).

        *   Students will be able to count to answer "how many?" questions about as many as [target, e.g., 5, then 10] things arranged in a line, a rectangular array, or a circle (K.CC.B.5).
        *   Students will be able to identify whether the number of objects in one group is greater than, less than, or equal to the number of objects in another group, e.g., by using matching and counting strategies (for groups up to 5) (K.CC.C.6).
    *   Essential Questions: How do we count? What do numbers mean? How can we tell if one group has more than another?
*   **Unit 2: Exploring Shapes (2D and 3D)**
    *   Key Concepts: Identifying and describing common 2D shapes (circle, square, triangle, rectangle, hexagon) by their attributes (number of sides, corners). Identifying common 3D shapes (cube, cone, cylinder, sphere) by their attributes (faces, ability to roll or stack). Composing simple shapes to form larger shapes.
    *   Learning Objectives:
        *   Students will be able to describe objects in the environment using names of shapes, and describe the relative positions of these objects using terms such as above, below, beside, in front of, behind, and next to (K.G.A.1).
        *   Students will be able to correctly name shapes regardless of their orientations or overall size (K.G.A.2).

        *   Students will be able to analyze and compare two- and three-dimensional shapes, in different sizes and orientations, using informal language to describe their similarities, differences, parts (e.g., number of sides and vertices/"corners") and other attributes (e.g., having sides of equal length) (K.G.B.4).
        *   Students will be able to model shapes in the world by building shapes from components (e.g., sticks and clay balls) and drawing shapes (K.G.B.5).
        *   Students will be able to compose simple shapes to form larger shapes. For example, "Can you join these two triangles with full sides touching to make a rectangle?" (K.G.B.6).

    *   Learning Objectives:
        *   Students will be able to compose and decompose numbers from 11 to 19 into ten ones and some further ones, e.g., by using objects or drawings, and record each composition or decomposition by a drawing or equation (e.g., 18 = 10 + 8); understand that these numbers are composed of ten ones and one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, or nine ones (K.NBT.A.1).
    *   Essential Questions: What do numbers like 11, 12, 13 mean? How can we show these bigger numbers with tens and ones?

## III. Instructional Strategies & Resources
