# Kindergarten Music Curriculum: Discovering the Joy of Music

## I. Overview and Alignment
*   **Subject Description:** Kindergarten music is an active, experiential journey into the world of sound, rhythm, and melody. Students will explore music through singing, playing simple instruments, moving, listening, and creating. The curriculum aims to foster a love of music, develop foundational musical skills, and encourage creative expression in a playful and supportive environment.

## II. Core Concepts / Units

*   **Unit 1: My Voice, My Music**
    *   Key Concepts: Discovering the singing voice vs. speaking voice. Exploring different vocal sounds (whispering, talking, shouting, singing). Matching pitch (simple patterns). Singing simple folk songs, nursery rhymes, and call-and-response songs.
    *   Learning Objectives:
        *   Students will be able to distinguish between their singing and speaking voices.
        *   Students will be able to echo short melodic patterns sung by the teacher.
        *   Students will be able to participate in group singing of simple songs.
    *   Essential Questions: What different sounds can my voice make? How is singing different from talking? What songs do we like to sing?
*   **Unit 2: Feeling the Beat**
    *   Key Concepts: Understanding steady beat as the underlying pulse in music. Moving to the steady beat (clapping, marching, tapping). Identifying fast and slow tempos. Playing simple percussion instruments to a steady beat.
    *   Learning Objectives:
        *   Students will be able to demonstrate a steady beat through movement (e.g., clapping, marching).
        *   Students will be able to identify fast and slow music.
        *   Students will be able to play a simple percussion instrument on the beat with teacher guidance.
    *   Essential Questions: What is the heartbeat of music? How can we move to the beat? Does music always go at the same speed?
*   **Unit 3: Loud and Soft, High and Low (Dynamics and Pitch)**
    *   Key Concepts: Exploring dynamics: loud (forte) and soft (piano). Exploring pitch: high and low sounds. Using voices and instruments to demonstrate loud/soft and high/low. Relating high/low to melodic contour (up and down).
    *   Learning Objectives:
        *   Students will be able to demonstrate loud and soft sounds with their voices and instruments.
        *   Students will be able to identify high and low sounds.
        *   Students will be able to show the direction of a simple melody (up/down) with hand movements.
    *   Essential Questions: Can music be loud or quiet? Can sounds be high or low? How does the melody move?
*   **Unit 4: Making Music Together (Simple Instruments and Ensemble)**
    *   Key Concepts: Identifying common classroom percussion instruments (rhythm sticks, shakers, drums, tambourines, triangles, xylophones - basic introduction). Learning proper playing techniques and care for instruments. Playing instruments together as a simple ensemble to accompany songs or keep a beat.
    *   Learning Objectives:
        *   Students will be able to identify by sight and sound several common classroom percussion instruments.
        *   Students will be able to demonstrate basic proper technique for playing selected instruments.
        *   Students will be able to play simple rhythmic patterns on instruments as part of a group.
    *   Essential Questions: What instruments can we play? How do we make different sounds with instruments? How can we make music together?
*   **Unit 5: Music Tells a Story / Music Makes Us Feel**
    *   Key Concepts: Listening to music and describing how it makes them feel (happy, sad, excited, sleepy). Understanding that music can tell a story or paint a picture (programmatic music examples, e.g., "Peter and the Wolf" snippets). Moving expressively to different types of music.
    *   Learning Objectives:
        *   Students will be able to use feeling words to describe how a piece of music makes them feel.
        *   Students will be able to identify if music sounds like it's telling a story or showing an image (with guidance).
        *   Students will be able to move their bodies in ways that reflect the mood or character of the music.
    *   Essential Questions: How does music make you feel? Can music tell a story without words? How can we show music with our bodies?
*   **Unit 6: Creating Our Own Music (Improvisation and Composition - Very Basic)**
    *   Key Concepts: Experimenting with sounds to create short musical ideas. Making up simple rhythmic patterns. Making up short melodic patterns on xylophones or with voices. Using iconic notation (pictures, shapes) to represent musical ideas.
    *   Learning Objectives:
        *   Students will be able to create a short rhythmic or melodic pattern using voice or instruments.
        *   Students will be able to use simple pictures or symbols to show a musical idea (e.g., a big circle for a loud sound, a small circle for a soft sound).
    *   Essential Questions: Can we make up our own music? How can we share our musical ideas?

## III. Instructional Strategies & Resources
*   **Key Pedagogical Approaches:** Orff-Schulwerk (sing, say, dance, play), Kod√°ly method (folk songs, solfege - simplified, hand signs), Dalcroze Eurhythmics (movement-based learning), active listening, call and response, echo songs, movement exploration, instrument exploration, storytelling through music.
*   **Potential Interdisciplinary Connections:**
    *   Language Arts: Rhyming, patterns in songs, storytelling, vocabulary (loud, soft, fast, slow).
    *   Math: Counting beats, patterns in rhythms.
    *   Art: Drawing to music, creating visual representations of sound.
    *   Physical Education: Movement, dance, coordination.
*   **Ideas for Supplemental Materials & Technology Integration:**
    *   Materials: Quality children's song recordings (folk songs, classical snippets, multicultural music), classroom percussion instruments (rhythm sticks, egg shakers, hand drums, tambourines, triangles, resonator bells, simple xylophones), scarves or ribbons for movement, visual aids (posters for dynamics, tempo, iconic notation), puppets, storybooks that can be musicalized.
    *   Technology: Interactive whiteboard for displaying song lyrics, iconic notation, or music-related visuals. Short video clips of musical performances (age-appropriate, diverse styles). Simple music creation apps (e.g., Chrome Music Lab - with significant teacher guidance). Audio player for listening examples.

## IV. Assessment Strategies
*   **Formative Assessments (Primarily Observational and Performance-Based):**
    *   Teacher observation of student participation in singing, moving, and playing instruments.
    *   Student ability to echo rhythmic and melodic patterns.
    *   Student responses to questions about music (e.g., "Is this music fast or slow?").
    *   Demonstration of steady beat through clapping or playing.
    *   Informal checks for understanding of concepts like loud/soft, high/low.
*   **Summative Assessments (Informal, Performance-Based):**
    *   Group performance of a learned song with actions or simple instrument accompaniment.
    *   Ability to identify a few classroom instruments by sight and sound.
    *   A simple creative task, such as making up a short rhythm to go with their name.
    *   Drawing a picture to represent how a piece of music makes them feel.
*   **Accommodations & Modifications (IDEA/504):**
    *   Adaptive instruments or modified playing techniques (e.g., larger mallets, instruments played on lap).
    *   Visual cues for beat, pitch direction, or dynamics.
    *   Peer buddies for movement or instrument playing activities.
    *   Choice of ways to participate (e.g., choosing to sing or play an instrument, choosing a movement).
    *   Breaking down multi-step musical tasks.
*   **ELL Support Strategies:**
    *   Use of universal musical elements (beat, rhythm) that transcend language.
    *   Many songs have repetitive lyrics, making them accessible.
    *   Extensive use of movement, gestures, and visual aids.
    *   Pairing with supportive peers.
    *   Focusing on participation and enjoyment over perfect pronunciation in songs.
