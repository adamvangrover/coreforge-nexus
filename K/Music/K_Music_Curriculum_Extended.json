      "Develop a movement activity where students use scarves or ribbons to 'paint' in the air, responding to the mood and flow of different musical selections.",
      "Create a simple 'Music and Feelings' matching worksheet where students draw a line from a feeling face (happy, sad, sleepy, excited) to a type of music described simply (e.g., 'fast and jumpy music,' 'slow and quiet music')."

    "unit_6_creating_our_own_music": [
      "Design a 'Sound Story' activity where the class creates a simple story, and students choose classroom instruments to represent different characters or actions, improvising sounds at the appropriate times.",
      "Generate a template for iconic notation where students can draw pictures (e.g., short lines for short sounds, long lines for long sounds, big dots for loud, small dots for soft) to represent a simple rhythm they create.",
      "Create a guided improvisation activity for barred instruments (xylophones/metallophones): Teacher sets a simple beat, students take turns playing a few notes (from a limited selection, e.g., pentatonic scale) to the beat."
