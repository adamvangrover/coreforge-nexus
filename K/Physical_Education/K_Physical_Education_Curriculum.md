# Kindergarten Physical Education Curriculum: Fun with Movement!

## I. Overview and Alignment
*   **Subject Description:** Kindergarten Physical Education (PE) focuses on developing fundamental movement skills, promoting physical activity as enjoyable, and introducing concepts of health-related fitness and cooperative play. The curriculum emphasizes active participation, exploration of movement, and learning basic rules for games and safety in a supportive and fun environment.
*   **Learning Standards Addressed (Example - Aligned with SHAPE America National Standards for K-12 Physical Education - Grade K Excerpts):**
    *   **Standard 1:** The physically literate individual demonstrates competency in a variety of motor skills and movement patterns.
        *   (e.g., S1.E1.K: Performs locomotor skills (e.g., hop, gallop, run, slide, skip) while maintaining balance.)
        *   (e.g., S1.E2.K: Performs non-locomotor skills (e.g., bend, stretch, twist, turn) with control.)
        *   (e.g., S1.E3.K: Throws underhand with opposite foot forward.)
        *   (e.g., S1.E4.K: Catches a gently tossed large ball from a short distance.)
    *   **Standard 2:** The physically literate individual applies knowledge of concepts, principles, strategies, and tactics related to movement and performance.
        *   (e.g., S2.E1.K: Differentiates between movement in personal space and general space.)
        *   (e.g., S2.E2.K: Recognizes different pathways (e.g., straight, curved, zigzag).)
    *   **Standard 3:** The physically literate individual demonstrates the knowledge and skills to achieve and maintain a health-enhancing level of physical activity and fitness.
        *   (e.g., S3.E1.K: Identifies physical activity as important for good health.)
        *   (e.g., S3.E2.K: Recognizes that the heart beats faster during physical activity.)
    *   **Standard 4:** The physically literate individual exhibits responsible personal and social behavior that respects self and others.
        *   (e.g., S4.E1.K: Follows directions for safe participation and proper use of equipment with minimal reminders.)
        *   (e.g., S4.E2.K: Shares equipment and space with others.)
    *   **Standard 5:** The physically literate individual recognizes the value of physical activity for health, enjoyment, challenge, self-expression, and/or social interaction.
        *   (e.g., S5.E1.K: Recognizes that physical activity is enjoyable.)
        *   (e.g., S5.E2.K: Expresses feelings about physical activity experiences.)
*   **Federal Mandate Considerations:** Promoting active lifestyles from a young age to combat childhood obesity and support overall well-being.
*   **Statutory Instructional Mandates Integrated:** (If applicable, e.g., specific minutes of PE per week, safety guidelines).

## II. Core Concepts / Units

## III. Instructional Strategies & Resources
*   **Key Pedagogical Approaches:** Direct instruction for skill introduction, guided discovery, creative movement exploration, low-organization games, station work, use of music to cue movement, positive reinforcement, clear and concise instructions, visual demonstrations.
*   **Potential Interdisciplinary Connections:**
    *   Math: Counting repetitions, identifying pathways (straight, curved), spatial awareness.
    *   Language Arts: Following directions, learning vocabulary for movement (hop, skip, under, over).
    *   Music: Moving to rhythm and tempo.
    *   Health: Understanding benefits of physical activity.
*   **Ideas for Supplemental Materials & Technology Integration:**
    *   Materials: Cones, floor spots/markers, beanbags, various sizes/textures of balls (playground balls, foam balls, beach balls), hoops, jump ropes (short, for individual exploration), scarves, balance beams (low to ground), tunnels, parachute (small for K). Music player and age-appropriate music.
    *   Technology: Projector for showing short video clips of specific skills (e.g., different animal walks, basic sport skills - very brief). Music streaming services. Pedometer for teacher to demonstrate step counting (optional).

## IV. Assessment Strategies
*   **Formative Assessments (Primarily Observational):**
    *   Teacher observation of student skill attempts during activities.
    *   Checklists for locomotor skills, non-locomotor skills, and basic manipulative skills (e.g., "Can hop on one foot," "Catches large ball").
    *   Student response to cues and directions.
    *   Observation of participation level and effort.
    *   Informal questioning (e.g., "Show me how you can move in your own space").
*   **Summative Assessments (Informal, Performance-Based):**
    *   Demonstration of a few key skills learned during a unit (e.g., galloping across the gym, throwing a beanbag into a hoop).
    *   Participation in a culminating game or activity that uses learned skills.
    *   Ability to follow rules and cooperate in a group game.
*   **Accommodations & Modifications (IDEA/504):**
    *   Modified equipment (e.g., larger/softer balls, lighter beanbags, lower targets).
    *   Peer buddies for support.
    *   Visual cues and demonstrations.
    *   Breaking down skills into smaller steps.
    *   Providing choices in activities or levels of challenge.
    *   Reduced waiting times.
*   **ELL Support Strategies:**
    *   Extensive use of demonstrations and gestures.
    *   Pairing movement words with the action.
    *   Using visual aids for rules or station instructions.
    *   Learning key PE vocabulary (stop, go, jump, run) with picture support.
    *   Partnering with supportive peers.
