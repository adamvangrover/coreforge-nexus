# Kindergarten Science Curriculum: Exploring the World Around Me

## I. Overview and Alignment
*   **Subject Description:** Kindergarten science is an inquiry-based exploration of the natural world. Students will engage their senses, ask questions, make observations, and conduct simple investigations to learn about physical science (properties of objects, forces), life science (plants, animals, human body), and Earth science (weather, seasons, natural materials). The curriculum fosters curiosity, critical thinking, and foundational scientific process skills.
