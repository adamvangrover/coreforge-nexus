*   **Subject Description:** Kindergarten Social Studies introduces children to concepts of self, family, school, community, and the wider world in age-appropriate ways. The curriculum focuses on developing an understanding of social interactions, roles and responsibilities, basic geography, simple economics, and cultural awareness through stories, discussions, play, and hands-on activities.
*   **Learning Standards Addressed (Example - Aligned with C3 Framework for Social Studies State Standards - Kindergarten Dimensions & Inquiry Arcs - Simplified):**
    *   **Dimension 1: Developing Questions and Planning Inquiries:** (e.g., Ask questions about self, family, school, and community.)
    *   **Dimension 2: Applying Disciplinary Concepts and Tools:**
        *   Civics: (e.g., K.Civ.1 Describe roles and responsibilities of people in authority. K.Civ.2 Explain the need for rules.)
        *   Economics: (e.g., K.Econ.1 Describe examples of goods and services. K.Econ.2 Explain that people have jobs to earn money to buy things they need or want.)

## III. Instructional Strategies & Resources
*   **Key Pedagogical Approaches:** Read-alouds of fiction and non-fiction books, discussions, role-playing, dramatic play (e.g., community helper center), guest speakers (e.g., firefighter, parent sharing a cultural tradition), creating charts and graphs (e.g., "Our Favorite Community Helper"), drawing and labeling, constructing models (e.g., building a neighborhood with blocks), virtual field trips (short videos).
*   **Potential Interdisciplinary Connections:**
    *   Language Arts: Reading books about families, communities, history; writing about personal experiences; vocabulary development.

    *   Math: Graphing favorite community helpers; using positional words; counting people in families.
    *   Music: Songs about community, friendship, holidays.
*   **Ideas for Supplemental Materials & Technology Integration:**
    *   Materials: Picture books, photographs (families, community places, historical images - simplified), puppets, dress-up clothes for dramatic play, blocks, construction paper, crayons/markers, globe, simple maps, U.S. flag.
    *   Technology: Interactive whiteboard for displaying maps, images, or virtual tours. Short educational videos about community helpers, different cultures, or historical events (age-appropriate, e.g., from PBS Kids). Simple map-making tools online (teacher-guided).

## IV. Assessment Strategies
*   **Formative Assessments (Primarily Observational and Performance-Based):**
    *   Teacher observation of student participation in discussions, role-playing, and group activities.
    *   Student responses to questions during read-alouds and discussions.
    *   Drawings and dictated stories related to unit themes (e.g., "Draw your family," "Draw a community helper").
    *   Ability to identify key people, places, or concepts on picture cards or in scenarios.
*   **Summative Assessments (Informal, Project-Based):**
    *   Creating a class book about "Our School Community" or "Community Helpers."
    *   Building a collaborative block model of a neighborhood and labeling parts.
    *   A simple "All About Me" poster.
    *   Participating in a role-play demonstrating understanding of a community helper's job or a school rule.
*   **Accommodations & Modifications (IDEA/504):**
    *   Use of visual aids (picture schedules, social stories).
    *   Breaking down tasks into smaller steps.
    *   Providing choices in activities or how to share learning (e.g., drawing vs. telling).
    *   Peer buddies for collaborative tasks.
    *   Sentence starters for discussions or dictated stories.
*   **ELL Support Strategies:**
    *   Extensive use of visuals, realia, and gestures.
    *   Pre-teaching key vocabulary with pictures and actions.
    *   Pairing with bilingual peers.
    *   Allowing students to use their L1 to clarify understanding with peers or bilingual staff.
    *   Using picture books with clear illustrations and repetitive text.
    *   Focusing on concrete examples and hands-on activities.
