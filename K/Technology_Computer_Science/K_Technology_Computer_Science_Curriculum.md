# Kindergarten Technology & Computer Science Curriculum: Playful Tech Explorers

## I. Overview and Alignment
*   **Subject Description:** Kindergarten Technology and Computer Science (CS) introduces young children to foundational concepts of technology use, digital citizenship, and computational thinking in an age-appropriate, play-based manner. The focus is on hands-on exploration, problem-solving, and understanding how technology helps us, rather than on complex programming or abstract theories.
*   **Learning Standards Addressed (Example - Aligned with CSTA K-12 CS Standards & ISTE Standards for Students - Kindergarten Level Interpretations):**
    *   **CSTA - Computing Systems (CS):**
        *   1A-CS-01: Select and use appropriate hardware and software for a variety of tasks. (K-level: Identify parts of a computer/tablet like screen, mouse, keyboard; open/close a simple app).
        *   1A-CS-02: Describe how hardware and software work together as a system to accomplish tasks. (K-level: Understand that clicking an icon (software) makes something happen on the screen (hardware)).
    *   **CSTA - Networks and the Internet (NI):** (Minimal for K, focus on local device use)
    *   **CSTA - Data and Analysis (DA):**
        *   1A-DA-04: Collect and present the same data in various visual formats. (K-level: With guidance, create simple pictographs of class favorites using digital tools or manipulatives).
    *   **CSTA - Algorithms and Programming (AP):**
        *   1A-AP-08: Model daily processes by creating and following algorithms (sets of step-by-step instructions) to complete tasks. (K-level: Follow multi-step oral directions; create simple sequences for a programmable toy or character in a game).
        *   1A-AP-10: Develop programs with sequences and simple loops, to express ideas or address a problem. (K-level: Use block-based coding apps to make a character move in a sequence; understand repeating a step).
        *   1A-AP-14: Debug (identify and fix) errors in an algorithm or program that includes sequences and simple loops. (K-level: Notice when a programmable toy isn't doing what was expected and try a different instruction).
    *   **CSTA - Impacts of Computing (IC):**
        *   1A-IC-16: Compare different ways people live and work in regions with varying access to computing devices and the Internet. (K-level: Discuss how technology is used at home and school; understand some people might not have these tools).
        *   1A-IC-18: Discuss how computing technologies have changed the world, and express how those technologies influence, and are influenced by, cultural practices. (K-level: Talk about how we use computers/tablets for learning, games, talking to family far away).
    *   **ISTE - Empowered Learner:** (e.g., Students understand the fundamental concepts of technology operations, demonstrate the ability to choose, use and troubleshoot current technologies and are able to transfer their knowledge to explore emerging technologies.) *K-level: Try different apps; ask for help when tech doesn't work.*
    *   **ISTE - Digital Citizen:** (e.g., Students recognize the rights, responsibilities and opportunities of living, learning and working in an interconnected digital world, and they act and model in ways that are safe, legal and ethical.) *K-level: Understand basic online safety rules (ask grown-up before clicking, don't share personal info); be kind online (if applicable).*
    *   **ISTE - Computational Thinker:** (e.g., Students develop and employ strategies for understanding and solving problems in ways that leverage the power of technological methods to develop and test solutions.) *K-level: Break down a task into steps for a programmable toy; try different solutions if the first one doesn't work.*
*   **Federal Mandate Considerations:** Early exposure to computational thinking and digital literacy skills.
*   **Statutory Instructional Mandates Integrated:** (If applicable, e.g., specific requirements for screen time, digital citizenship education).

*   **Key Pedagogical Approaches:** Play-based learning, guided exploration, direct instruction for basic skills, collaborative problem-solving, "unplugged" activities (teaching CS concepts without devices, e.g., acting out algorithms), modeling, think-alouds by the teacher.
*   **Potential Interdisciplinary Connections:**
    *   Language Arts: Following directions, sequencing stories (algorithm connection), using keyboard to find letters.
    *   Math: Creating patterns (algorithm connection), using programmable toys to move to specific numbers or shapes, graphing.
    *   Art: Using digital drawing tools.
    *   Science: Using technology to observe (digital microscope, videos), programming a toy to navigate a "habitat."
*   **Ideas for Supplemental Materials & Technology Integration:**
    *   Materials: Classroom computers/laptops, tablets, interactive whiteboard, programmable floor robots (Bee-Bot, Code & Go Robot Mouse, Dash - simplified use), age-appropriate software/apps (drawing programs, simple coding apps like Kodable, ScratchJr, Lightbot Jr.), digital camera, headphones. Unplugged activity resources (cards for sequencing, grid mats).
    *   Technology: The devices and software listed above. Teacher resources for CS education (e.g., Code.org K-5 curriculum, CS First).

## IV. Assessment Strategies
*   **Formative Assessments (Primarily Observational and Performance-Based):**
    *   Teacher observation of student engagement and interaction with technology.
    *   Student ability to follow directions for using devices and software.
    *   Checklists for basic skills (e.g., "Can point and click," "Can open app X," "Can input 2 commands for robot").
    *   Student verbal explanations of their problem-solving steps during coding or robot activities.
    *   Completed tasks in apps (e.g., levels in Kodable, simple ScratchJr project).
*   **Summative Assessments (Informal, Project-Based):**
    *   Successfully programming a robot to navigate a simple maze or reach a target.
    *   Creating a simple digital drawing or contributing to a class digital project.
    *   Explaining (verbally or by demonstration) how to complete a simple tech task (e.g., "Show me how you make the character move forward").
*   **Accommodations & Modifications (IDEA/504):**
    *   Adaptive hardware if needed (e.g., larger mouse, specialized keyboard - if available and appropriate).
    *   Simplified software interfaces or apps with fewer steps.
    *   Peer buddies for support with tech tasks.
    *   Visual cues for multi-step directions or coding blocks.
    *   Breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable parts.
    *   Allowing extra time for exploration and task completion.
*   **ELL Support Strategies:**
    *   Use of visual icons and symbols in software and instructions.
    *   Pairing with bilingual peers.
    *   Modeling and demonstration with minimal verbal instruction initially.
    *   Many coding apps use universal symbols, reducing language barriers.
    *   Pre-teaching key tech vocabulary (click, drag, open, close, forward, turn).
