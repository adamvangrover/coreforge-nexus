      "Design a project where students use a simple digital drawing tool to illustrate their favorite part of a story read in class. They can then share their drawings with a partner.",
      "Generate a plan for creating a class pictograph about favorite animals: Students choose a digital picture of their favorite animal, and the teacher helps them arrange these into a graph on the interactive whiteboard. Discuss which animal is most/least popular.",
      "Create a 'Digital Storytelling' activity: Students take turns adding a sentence (dictated to the teacher who types it) to a collaborative class story, and then use a drawing app to illustrate their sentence. Combine into a class e-book or slideshow."
