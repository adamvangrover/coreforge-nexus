# Grades K-5 - The Arts (Visual Arts, Music, Theatre, Dance) - NYS Arts Standards
**Note: The content herein is a proposed draft for Subject Matter Expert (SME) review and expansion. This framework provides examples for Visual Arts and Music; similar structures would apply for Theatre and Dance based on school programs.**

## I. Overview and Alignment
*   **Subject Description:** Elementary Arts Education (K-5) aims to develop artistic literacy by engaging students in the four artistic processes: Creating, Performing/Presenting/Producing, Responding, and Connecting. Students explore various art forms (Visual Arts, Music, and potentially Theatre, Dance, Media Arts based on school resources), fostering creativity, critical thinking, communication, and cultural understanding.
*   **NYS Learning Standards Addressed:** (Progressively across K-5, with increasing complexity, referencing the NYS P-12 Learning Standards for the Arts. Each discipline has specific anchor standards and grade-band expectations within the four artistic processes.)
    *   **Artistic Process 1: Creating:** Conceiving and developing new artistic ideas and work.
    *   **Artistic Process 2: Performing/Presenting/Producing:** Realizing artistic ideas and work through interpretation and presentation. (Music, Dance, Theatre: Performing; Visual Arts: Presenting; Media Arts: Producing)
    *   **Artistic Process 3: Responding:** Understanding and evaluating how the arts convey meaning.
    *   **Artistic Process 4: Connecting:** Relating artistic ideas and work with personal meaning and external context.
*   **Federal Mandate Considerations (if applicable):** ESSA's focus on well-rounded education, IDEA principles for UDL ensuring access and multiple means of engagement, representation, and expression.
*   **Statutory Instructional Mandates Integrated (if applicable):** Themes of Civility, Citizenship, Patriotism, and Human Rights can be explored through the content and context of artworks, songs, plays, and dances from various cultures and historical periods.

## II. Core Concepts / Units (Conceptual - organized by themes/processes across K-5, adaptable by discipline)
(Logically sequenced units or major topics, progressively building skills from K to 5 for each arts discipline offered.)

**A. Visual Arts Example Progression (K-5 Focus)**
*   **Unit VA1 (K-1): Exploring Our World with Lines, Shapes, and Colors**
    *   **Key Concepts:** Identifying and using basic art elements: line (straight, curvy, zigzag), shape (geometric, organic), color (primary, secondary), texture (implied, actual - simple). Safe use of tools (scissors, glue, crayons, paint). (Creating, Responding)
    *   **Learning Objectives (Proposed - K):**
        *   Students will be able to identify and create different types of lines and shapes in their artwork. (VA.Cr1.1.Ka, VA.Cr2.1.Ka)
        *   Students will be able to name and use primary colors in a painting. (VA.Cr2.1.Ka, VA.Re7.1.Ka)

**(Similar progressions would be outlined for Theatre and Dance if these disciplines are part of the K-5 arts program, focusing on age-appropriate skills in acting, movement, storytelling, choreography, technical elements, etc.)**

## III. Instructional Strategies & Resources
*   **Key Pedagogical Approaches:** UDL principles, active, hands-on participation, studio-based learning (Visual Arts), performance-based learning (Music, Dance, Theatre), Orff-Schulwerk, Kod√°ly, Dalcroze methods (Music), creative movement, process drama, project-based learning, inquiry-based explorations, gallery walks, listening experiences, peer collaboration, visiting artists/performers (if possible).
*   **Potential Interdisciplinary Connections:**
    *   **Visual Arts:** Illustrating stories from ELA, creating props/scenery for Theatre, designing patterns based on Math concepts, studying art from historical periods in Social Studies.
    *   **Music:** Setting poems to music (ELA), exploring the science of sound (Science), learning cultural songs and dances (Social Studies), using rhythms in math games (Math).
    *   **Theatre/Dance (Examples):** Acting out historical events (Social Studies), creating dances based on scientific concepts (Science), developing characters from literature (ELA).
*   **Ideas for Supplemental Materials & Technology Integration:**
    *   **Visual Arts:** Wide range of art supplies (crayons, markers, paint, paper, clay, collage materials, recyclables), reproductions of artworks, age-appropriate art books, digital drawing tablets (optional), online art galleries.
    *   **Music:** Classroom instruments (percussion, xylophones, recorders, keyboards), songbooks, sheet music (simplified), recordings of diverse music genres and cultures, music notation software (for older grades/teacher use), interactive music apps.
    *   **Theatre:** Simple props, costumes, puppets, space for movement/performance, scripts (age-appropriate), recording devices for practice.
    *   **Dance:** Open space for movement, music, scarves, ribbons, mirrors (if available), video recording for self-assessment.

## IV. Assessment Strategies
*   **Formative Assessments:** Teacher observation of student participation and process, sketchbooks/idea journals, class discussions and critiques (age-appropriate language), skill demonstrations (e.g., playing a rhythm, mixing a color, performing a dance step), question/answer sessions, exit tickets related to concepts learned.
*   **Summative Assessments:**
    *   **Visual Arts:** Portfolios of completed artworks (evaluated with rubrics focusing on creativity, craftsmanship, application of concepts), artist statements (simple, oral or written), participation in a class art show.
    *   **Music:** Performance assessments (singing, playing instruments - individual or group), creating short musical compositions or improvisations, written or oral responses to listening examples, identifying musical elements.
    *   **Theatre/Dance (Examples):** Performance of short scenes or dances, creation of original movement pieces or character portrayals, design projects (costume/set sketches).
*   **Accommodations & Modifications (IDEA/504):** Adaptive art tools or musical instruments, choice of materials, media, or performance roles, visual/auditory aids for instructions and demonstrations, simplified instructions or tasks, peer support, alternative methods for demonstrating understanding (e.g., verbal explanation instead of written, drawing instead of performing a complex motor skill if appropriate).
*   **ELL Support Strategies:** Visual glossaries for arts terms, extensive modeling and demonstration, non-verbal ways to participate and express (e.g., drawing, moving, playing an instrument), use of music, visual arts, and stories from students' home cultures, collaborative group work, sentence frames for discussions and critiques.
