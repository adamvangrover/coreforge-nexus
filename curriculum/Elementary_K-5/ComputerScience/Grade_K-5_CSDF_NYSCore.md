## I. Overview and Alignment
*   **Subject Description:** This K-5 Computer Science and Digital Fluency curriculum introduces students to foundational concepts across five key areas: Impacts of Computing (IC), Computational Thinking (CT), Networks & System Design (NSD), Cybersecurity (CS), and Digital Literacy (DL). Learning is progressive, with age-appropriate activities designed to build skills and understanding from Kindergarten through Grade 5, often integrated with other subject areas.
*   **NYS Learning Standards Addressed:** (Specific K-2 and 3-5 grade-band standards for each of the five core concepts, as outlined in the NYS K-12 Computer Science and Digital Fluency Learning Standards. Examples below are illustrative.)
    *   **Impacts of Computing (IC):** K-2.IC.1 (Identify computing devices and explain how they are used in daily life), 3-5.IC.3 (Discuss the positive and negative impacts of technology on society and the environment).
    *   **Computational Thinking (CT):** K-2.CT.2 (Decompose a simple problem or task into a sequence of steps), 3-5.CT.4 (Create and debug algorithms that include sequencing, loops, and conditionals).
    *   **Networks & System Design (NSD):** K-2.NSD.1 (Identify and describe the function of common hardware components), 3-5.NSD.2 (Explain that the Internet is a network of networks that connects devices).
    *   **Cybersecurity (CS):** K-2.CS.1 (Explain that personal information should be kept private and identify trusted adults to help), 3-5.CS.2 (Identify common online safety risks and demonstrate strategies to protect personal information).

## II. Core Concepts / Units (Conceptual - organized by the five CS & DF strands, with K-2 and 3-5 distinctions)
(Logically sequenced units or major topics, ensuring coverage of all five concepts across K-5. These are often integrated into other subjects or taught in dedicated modules.)

**1. Impacts of Computing (IC): Technology in Our Lives**
*   **Key Concepts (K-2):** Identifying computers and technology in everyday places (home, school, community). How technology helps people learn, play, and do jobs.
*   **Key Concepts (3-5):** How technology has changed communication, learning, and work. Positive (e.g., access to information, connecting people) and negative (e.g., screen time, misinformation, digital divide) impacts. Ethical considerations of technology use. Digital citizenship: rights and responsibilities online.

        *   (K) Students will be able to point to three different computing devices in the classroom or school.
        *   (4th) Students will be able to list one positive and one potential negative impact of using the internet for research.
*   **Essential Questions:** What is technology? How does technology help us? How can we use technology responsibly and kindly?

**2. Computational Thinking (CT): Solving Problems Step-by-Step**
*   **Key Concepts (K-2):** Sequencing (following multi-step directions), pattern recognition (in stories, songs, numbers), decomposition (breaking a big task into smaller parts, like getting ready for school), simple algorithms (a set of instructions, e.g., how to make a sandwich - unplugged). Introduction to block-based coding (e.g., directional commands for a character).
*   **Key Concepts (3-5):** Designing more complex algorithms (e.g., for a game or task), debugging (finding and fixing errors in instructions/code), loops (repeating actions), conditionals (if/then statements - "if the light is red, then stop"). Using block-based programming environments (e.g., Scratch, Code.org) to create stories, animations, and simple games.
*   **Learning Objectives (Proposed - examples):**
        *   (1st) Students will be able to put three picture cards representing a daily routine in the correct order.
        *   (5th) Students will be able to create a simple algorithm using loops to draw a square in a block-based programming environment and identify an error if it doesn't work as expected.
*   **Essential Questions:** How can we solve tricky problems? How do we give clear instructions? What do we do when our instructions don't work?

**3. Networks & System Design (NSD): How Computers Work and Connect**
*   **Key Concepts (K-2):** Identifying basic parts of a computer (monitor, keyboard, mouse, tablet screen) and their functions (input/output). Understanding that computers need power and instructions.
*   **Key Concepts (3-5):** Basic understanding of how computers connect (e.g., Wi-Fi, cables). Simple explanation of the internet as a way for computers to share information. Understanding that information is stored as data.
*   **Learning Objectives (Proposed - examples):**
        *   (K) Students will be able to identify the screen and keyboard as parts of a computer.
        *   (3rd) Students will be able to explain in simple terms that Wi-Fi helps computers connect without wires.
*   **Essential Questions:** What are the important parts of a computer? How do computers "talk" to each other?

**4. Cybersecurity (CS): Staying Safe Online**
*   **Key Concepts (K-2):** Keeping personal information private (name, address, phone number, passwords). Identifying trusted adults to talk to about online safety. Understanding that not everything online is true or safe.
*   **Key Concepts (3-5):** Creating strong passwords (and keeping them secret), recognizing online risks (e.g., cyberbullying, inappropriate content, talking to strangers online), understanding digital footprints (what we do online can be seen by others), importance of logging out.
*   **Learning Objectives (Proposed - examples):**

        *   (5th) Students will be able to describe one strategy for dealing with cyberbullying.
*   **Essential Questions:** What information is okay to share online, and what should be kept private? Who can help us if something online makes us feel uncomfortable or unsafe? How can we protect ourselves online?

**5. Digital Literacy (DL): Using Technology Effectively and Responsibly**
*   **Key Concepts (K-2):** Basic computer operations (turning on/off, using a mouse/touchscreen, opening/closing apps). Using common software for learning and creativity (drawing programs, educational games, simple word processors for typing names/short sentences).

## III. Instructional Strategies & Resources
*   **Key Pedagogical Approaches:** UDL principles, "unplugged" activities (teaching CS concepts without computers), block-based visual programming environments (e.g., ScratchJr, Scratch, Code.org Hour of Code activities), age-appropriate robotics tools (e.g., Bee-Bot, Cubetto, Dash, Sphero Indi), interactive read-alouds about technology/safety, collaborative projects, guided exploration of curated educational software and websites, role-playing online safety scenarios.
*   **Potential Interdisciplinary Connections:**

## IV. Assessment Strategies
*   **Formative Assessments:** Teacher observation of students during coding activities or unplugged tasks (checklists for CT skills like sequencing, debugging), student participation in discussions about online safety or impacts of technology, Q&A sessions, exit tickets with CS vocabulary or simple concept checks, peer review of simple programs or algorithms (with guidance).
*   **Summative Assessments:** Completion of coding projects (e.g., creating a simple animation in ScratchJr, programming a robot to navigate a maze), presentations demonstrating understanding of a CS concept (e.g., "How the Internet Helps Us"), creation of digital artifacts (e.g., a digital safety poster, a collaborative online document), simple quizzes on vocabulary or cybersecurity rules (using pictures for K-2).
*   **Accommodations & Modifications (IDEA/504):** Visual aids for coding blocks or CS concepts, simplified programming tasks or templates, pair programming with defined roles, text-to-speech for online resources or instructions, alternative input devices (adaptive mice, switches), extended time for tasks, choice in project topics or tools.
*   **ELL Support Strategies:** Visual programming environments that minimize language load, bilingual glossaries for CS terms, pairing with supportive peers, modeling and think-alouds by the teacher, projects that allow for creative expression beyond complex English (e.g., creating a visual story with minimal text), explicit instruction in key vocabulary with visuals and gestures.
