# Kindergarten - English Language Arts - NYS Next Generation ELA Standards
**Note: The content herein is a proposed draft for Subject Matter Expert (SME) review and expansion.**

## I. Overview and Alignment
*   **Subject Description:** This course develops foundational skills in reading, writing, speaking, and listening for Kindergarten students, fostering a love of language and literacy through engaging, developmentally appropriate activities.
*   **NYS Learning Standards Addressed:**
    *   **Reading (Foundational Skills):** KRF1 (Demonstrate understanding of the organization and basic features of print), KRF2 (Demonstrate understanding of spoken words, syllables, and sounds (phonemes)), KRF3 (Know and apply grade-level phonics and word analysis skills in decoding words), KRF4 (Read emergent-reader texts with purpose and understanding).
    *   **Reading (Literature & Informational Text):** KRL1 (With prompting and support, ask and answer questions about key details in a text), KRI1 (With prompting and support, ask and answer questions about key details in a text), KRL2 (With prompting and support, retell familiar stories, including key details), KRI2 (With prompting and support, identify the main topic and retell key details of a text).
    *   **Writing:** KW1 (Use a combination of drawing, dictating, and writing to compose opinion pieces), KW2 (Use a combination of drawing, dictating, and writing to compose informative/explanatory texts), KW3 (Use a combination of drawing, dictating, and writing to narrate a single event or several loosely linked events).
    *   **Speaking & Listening:** KSL1 (Participate in collaborative conversations with diverse partners about kindergarten topics and texts with peers and adults in small and larger groups), KSL2 (Confirm understanding of a text read aloud or information presented orally or through other media by asking and answering questions about key details and requesting clarification if something is not understood).
    *   **Language:** KL1 (Demonstrate command of the conventions of standard English grammar and usage when writing or speaking), KL2 (Demonstrate command of the conventions of standard English capitalization, punctuation, and spelling when writing).
*   **Federal Mandate Considerations (if applicable):** ESSA's focus on well-rounded education, IDEA principles for UDL ensuring access for all learners.
*   **Statutory Instructional Mandates Integrated (if applicable):** Civility and character education themes can be woven into discussions about stories and interactions.

## II. Core Concepts / Units
(Logically sequenced units or major topics)
*   **Unit 1: The Wonderful World of Books & Print**
    *   Key Concepts: Parts of a book (cover, title, author, illustrator), directionality of print (left to right, top to bottom), concept of a word and a letter, matching spoken words to written words.
    *   Learning Objectives (Proposed):
        *   Students will be able to identify the front cover, back cover, and title page of a book. (KRF1a)
        *   Students will be able to follow words from left to right, top to bottom, and page by page. (KRF1b)
        *   Students will be able to recognize that spoken words are represented in written language by specific sequences of letters. (KRF1c)
    *   Essential Questions: What can a book teach us? How do we hold and read a book? What is a word?
*   **Unit 2: Sounds All Around: Phonological Awareness Fun**
    *   Key Concepts: Recognizing rhyming words, counting and blending syllables in spoken words, isolating and pronouncing initial, medial vowel, and final sounds (phonemes) in CVC (consonant-vowel-consonant) words.
    *   Learning Objectives (Proposed):
        *   Students will be able to recognize and produce rhyming words. (KRF2a)
        *   Students will be able to count, pronounce, blend, and segment syllables in spoken words. (KRF2b)
        *   Students will be able to blend and segment onsets and rimes of single-syllable spoken words. (KRF2c)
        *   Students will be able to isolate and pronounce the initial, medial vowel, and final sounds (phonemes) in three-phoneme (CVC) words. (KRF2d)
    *   Essential Questions: What sounds do words make? How can we play with the sounds in words?
*   **Unit 3: ABCs and Decoding: Learning Letters and Sounds**
    *   Key Concepts: Letter-sound correspondence for common consonants and short vowels, decoding simple CVC words, recognizing some high-frequency sight words.
    *   Learning Objectives (Proposed):
        *   Students will be able to demonstrate basic knowledge of one-to-one letter-sound correspondences by producing the primary sound or sounds for each consonant. (KRF3a)
        *   Students will be able to associate the long and short sounds with common spellings (graphemes) for the five major vowels. (KRF3b)
        *   Students will be able to read common high-frequency words by sight (e.g., the, of, to, you, she, my, is, are, do, does). (KRF3c)
    *   Essential Questions: What sound does this letter make? How can knowing letter sounds help us read words?
*   **Unit 4: Telling Our Stories: Listening, Speaking, and Early Writing**
    *   Key Concepts: Participating in conversations, listening to others, asking and answering questions about stories, expressing ideas and opinions through drawing, dictating, and emergent writing.
    *   Learning Objectives (Proposed):
        *   Students will be able to follow agreed-upon rules for discussions (e.g., listening to others and taking turns speaking about the topics and texts under discussion). (KSL1a)
        *   Students will be able to use a combination of drawing, dictating, and writing to compose opinion pieces in which they tell a reader the topic or the name of the book they are writing about and state an opinion or preference about the topic or book. (KW1)
        *   Students will be able to describe familiar people, places, things, and events and, with prompting and support, provide additional detail. (KSL4)
    *   Essential Questions: How do we share our ideas with others? What makes a good story? How can we tell stories using pictures and words?

## III. Instructional Strategies & Resources
*   **Key Pedagogical Approaches:** UDL principles, explicit instruction, interactive read-alouds, shared reading and writing, guided reading, literacy centers/stations, multisensory activities (sand trays, magnetic letters), songs, chants, rhymes, dramatic play, think-pair-share.
*   **Potential Interdisciplinary Connections:** Storytelling in Arts (Puppets, drawing story scenes), Counting words/syllables in Math, Rhyming songs in Music, Learning about community helpers through informational texts (Social Studies).
*   **Ideas for Supplemental Materials & Technology Integration:** Rich variety of fiction and non-fiction picture books, big books, alphabet charts, letter tiles, magnetic letters, sound boxes, whiteboards/chart paper, puppets, storytelling props, educational apps for letter sounds and early reading (e.g., Starfall, ABCmouse - for review), interactive whiteboard games.

## IV. Assessment Strategies
*   **Formative Assessments:** Teacher observation during activities (anecdotal records, checklists), student responses during read-alouds, think-pair-share discussions, work samples from literacy centers (e.g., letter writing practice, rhyming word sorts), running records (simple for emergent readers), phonological awareness games (e.g., "I spy something that rhymes with...").
*   **Summative Assessments:** Portfolio of student work (drawings, writings, attempts at decoding), individual letter/sound recognition checks, sight word recognition checks, simple dictated sentences (student attempts to write), retelling of a familiar story (oral or with drawings).
*   **Accommodations & Modifications (IDEA/504):** Visual schedules, preferential seating, use of manipulatives for letter/sound work, larger print materials, reduced number of items for tasks, sensory breaks, options for demonstrating understanding (e.g., pointing, oral response instead of written).
*   **ELL Support Strategies:** Visual aids (pictures, realia, gestures), explicit vocabulary instruction with cognate connections where possible, peer pairing with supportive English-speaking peers, use of home language to clarify concepts when feasible, providing sentence frames for discussions, incorporating culturally relevant stories and materials.
