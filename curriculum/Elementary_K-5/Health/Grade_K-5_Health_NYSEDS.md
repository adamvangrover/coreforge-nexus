# Grades K-5 - Health Education - NYS Health Education Standards
**Note: The content herein is a proposed draft for Subject Matter Expert (SME) review and expansion.**

## I. Overview and Alignment
*   **Subject Description:** Elementary Health Education (K-5) provides students with foundational knowledge and skills to make healthy choices and live safe, productive lives. Content areas include personal health and hygiene, nutrition, physical activity, safety and injury prevention, mental and emotional health, disease prevention, and age-appropriate substance abuse prevention and safety topics (including child abduction and sexual abuse prevention). The curriculum emphasizes developing health literacy through skills such as accessing information, analyzing influences, decision-making, and interpersonal communication.
*   **NYS Learning Standards Addressed:** (Progressively across K-5, focusing on skills and age-appropriate content)
    *   **Standard 1: Personal Health and Fitness:** Students will have the necessary knowledge and skills to establish and maintain physical fitness, participate in physical activity, and maintain personal health. (Content Strands: Personal Health, Physical Activity, Nutrition)
    *   **Standard 2: A Safe and Healthy Environment:** Students will acquire the knowledge and ability necessary to create and maintain a safe and healthy environment. (Content Strands: Safety and Injury Prevention, Environmental Health)
    *   **Standard 3: Resource Management:** Students will understand and be able to manage personal and community resources. (Content Strands: Consumer Health, Community Health)
    *   **(Implicitly, skills like decision-making, communication, accessing information, analyzing influences, goal-setting, self-management, and advocacy are woven throughout as per the NYS Health Education Guidance Document and CDC's Health Education Curriculum Analysis Tool - HECAT).**
*   **Federal Mandate Considerations (if applicable):** ESSA's focus on well-rounded education, IDEA principles for UDL ensuring access for all learners.

## III. Instructional Strategies & Resources
*   **Key Pedagogical Approaches:** UDL principles, interactive discussions, role-playing scenarios, storytelling with health themes, read-alouds of age-appropriate books, guest speakers (e.g., firefighter, police officer, school nurse, dentist), visual aids (posters, diagrams, food models), puppet shows (for younger grades), cooperative learning activities, skill-building practice (e.g., decision-making steps, refusal skills).
*   **Potential Interdisciplinary Connections:** Reading books about feelings, friendship, and bodies (ELA), Graphing healthy food choices or survey data on safety habits (Math), Learning about the human body systems and germs (Science), Discussing community safety helpers (Social Studies), Creating health posters or songs (Arts).
*   **Ideas for Supplemental Materials & Technology Integration:** Children's books on various health topics (feelings, nutrition, safety, body science), videos (e.g., BrainPOP Jr. Health - for review), age-appropriate websites/apps for health games or information (e.g., PBS Kids health sections - for review), models of the human body/teeth, food pyramid/MyPlate visuals, first aid kit (for demonstration), puppets, chart paper, art supplies for posters.

## IV. Assessment Strategies
*   **Formative Assessments:** Class discussions and Q&A sessions, student drawings or writings related to health concepts (e.g., "Draw a healthy meal," "Write about a time you felt happy"), role-play scenario participation and reflection, checklists for understanding safety rules or hygiene steps, "Thumbs up/down" for concept checks.
*   **Summative Assessments:** Creating posters or brochures on health topics (e.g., "5 Ways to Stay Safe," "My Healthy Plate"), developing simple safety plans (e.g., fire escape plan), presentations (e.g., "How to be a Good Friend," "Why Handwashing is Important"), quizzes with pictures or simple written responses for older grades, demonstrating a learned skill (e.g., proper handwashing, stop-drop-roll).
*   **Accommodations & Modifications (IDEA/504):** Simplified language and instructions, visual schedules for routines (like handwashing steps), social stories for emotional regulation or safety procedures, choice in how to demonstrate understanding (e.g., drawing vs. writing, oral response), use of assistive technology for communication or writing, breaking tasks into smaller steps.
*   **ELL Support Strategies:** Bilingual glossaries for health terms, extensive use of visual aids (pictures, diagrams, realia) for body parts, foods, safety signs, etc., use of gestures and modeling, peer support for activities and discussions, translated materials for parents when possible and appropriate, connecting health concepts to practices in students' home cultures (e.g., traditional healthy foods, safety practices).
