## II. Core Concepts / Units
(Logically sequenced units or major topics)
*   **Unit 1: Sums and Differences to 10**
    *   Key Concepts: Representing addition and subtraction with objects, fingers, mental images, drawings, sounds, acting out situations, verbal explanations, expressions, or equations. Solving word problems that call for addition of three whole numbers whose sum is less than or equal to 20. Applying properties of operations as strategies (e.g., commutative, associative). Understanding subtraction as an unknown-addend problem.
    *   Learning Objectives (Proposed):
        *   Students will be able to use addition and subtraction within 10 to solve word problems involving situations of adding to, taking from, putting together, taking apart, and comparing, with unknowns in all positions. (1.OA.A.1)
        *   Students will be able to apply properties of operations as strategies to add and subtract (e.g., If 8 + 3 = 11 is known, then 3 + 8 = 11 is also known - Commutative property). (1.OA.B.3)
        *   Students will be able to relate counting to addition and subtraction (e.g., by counting on 2 to add 2). (1.OA.C.5)
    *   Essential Questions: How can we show addition and subtraction in different ways? How does knowing one math fact help us know another? How is counting related to adding and subtracting?
*   **Unit 2: Understanding Place Value: Tens and Ones**
    *   Key Concepts: Counting to 120, starting at any number less than 120. Understanding that the two digits of a two-digit number represent amounts of tens and ones. Comparing two two-digit numbers based on meanings of the tens and ones digits.
    *   Learning Objectives (Proposed):
        *   Students will be able to count to 120, starting at any number less than 120. In this range, read and write numerals and represent a number of objects with a written numeral. (1.NBT.A.1)
        *   Students will be able to understand that the two digits of a two-digit number represent amounts of tens and ones. (e.g., 23 is 2 tens and 3 ones). (1.NBT.B.2)
        *   Students will be able to compare two two-digit numbers based on meanings of the tens and ones digits, recording the results of comparisons with the symbols >, =, and <. (1.NBT.B.3)
    *   Essential Questions: How do tens and ones help us understand numbers? How can we tell if one number is bigger or smaller than another?
*   **Unit 3: Adding and Subtracting with Place Value (within 100)**
    *   Key Concepts: Adding within 100, including adding a two-digit number and a one-digit number, and adding a two-digit number and a multiple of 10, using concrete models or drawings and strategies based on place value. Subtracting multiples of 10 from multiples of 10.
    *   Learning Objectives (Proposed):
        *   Students will be able to add within 100, including adding a two-digit number and a one-digit number, and adding a two-digit number and a multiple of 10, using concrete models or drawings and strategies based on place value, properties of operations, and/or the relationship between addition and subtraction. (1.NBT.C.4)
        *   Students will be able to mentally find 10 more or 10 less than a given two-digit number, without having to count; explain the reasoning used. (1.NBT.C.5)
        *   Students will be able to subtract multiples of 10 in the range 10-90 from multiples of 10 in the range 10-90 (positive or zero differences), using concrete models or drawings and strategies based on place value. (1.NBT.C.6)
    *   Essential Questions: How can understanding tens and ones help us add and subtract larger numbers?
*   **Unit 4: Measuring Length and Telling Time**
    *   Key Concepts: Ordering three objects by length; comparing the lengths of two objects indirectly by using a third object. Expressing the length of an object as a whole number of length units, by laying multiple copies of a shorter object (the length unit) end to end. Telling and writing time in hours and half-hours using analog and digital clocks.
    *   Learning Objectives (Proposed):
        *   Students will be able to order three objects by length; compare the lengths of two objects indirectly by using a third object. (1.MD.A.1)
        *   Students will be able to express the length of an object as a whole number of length units, by laying multiple copies of a shorter object (the length unit) end to end; understand that the length measurement of an object is the number of same-size length units that span it with no gaps or overlaps. (1.MD.A.2)
        *   Students will be able to tell and write time in hours and half-hours using analog and digital clocks. (1.MD.B.3)
    *   Essential Questions: How can we compare how long things are? How do we use a clock to tell time?
*   **Unit 5: Shapes and Their Attributes**
    *   Key Concepts: Distinguishing between defining attributes (e.g., triangles are closed and three-sided) versus non-defining attributes (e.g., color, orientation, overall size). Composing two-dimensional shapes (rectangles, squares, trapezoids, triangles, half-circles, and quarter-circles) or three-dimensional shapes (cubes, right rectangular prisms, right circular cones, and right circular cylinders) to create a composite shape.
    *   Learning Objectives (Proposed):
        *   Students will be able to distinguish between defining attributes (e.g., triangles are closed and three-sided) versus non-defining attributes (e.g., color, orientation, overall size); build and draw shapes to possess defining attributes. (1.G.A.1)
        *   Students will be able to compose two-dimensional shapes or three-dimensional shapes to create a composite shape, and compose new shapes from the composite shape. (1.G.A.2)
    *   Essential Questions: What makes a shape a [triangle, square, etc.]? How can we put shapes together to make new shapes?

## III. Instructional Strategies & Resources
*   **Key Pedagogical Approaches:** UDL principles, Concrete-Representational-Abstract (CRA) instruction, use of manipulatives (counting bears, linking cubes, base-ten blocks, pattern blocks, attribute blocks, rulers, clocks), number lines, hundreds charts, math journals, math talks/number talks, problem-solving tasks, small group instruction, learning centers.
*   **Potential Interdisciplinary Connections:** Measuring plants in Science, Creating patterns with shapes in Art, Reading stories with number concepts in ELA, Sequencing events by time in Social Studies.
*   **Ideas for Supplemental Materials & Technology Integration:** Counting blocks, base-ten blocks, pattern blocks, attribute blocks, non-standard measurement tools (paperclips, cubes), classroom rulers (inch and centimeter), demonstration clocks (analog and digital), interactive whiteboard activities for sorting shapes or number lines, educational math apps focusing on addition/subtraction facts or place value (e.g., Todo Math, SplashLearn - for review).

## IV. Assessment Strategies
*   **Formative Assessments:** Math journal entries with drawings and explanations, exit tickets with 1-2 problems, teacher observation of student work with manipulatives, student explanations during math talks, "show me" with whiteboards, anecdotal records during small group work.
*   **Summative Assessments:** Unit tests with a mix of problem types (word problems, direct computation, drawing models), performance tasks (e.g., measuring objects in the classroom, building a composite shape and describing it, solving a multi-step word problem with manipulatives and explaining the solution), student interviews to assess understanding of concepts like place value.
*   **Accommodations & Modifications (IDEA/504):** Use of manipulatives for all tasks, visual aids like number lines or hundreds charts readily available, pre-drawn templates for recording work, reduced number of problems on assignments, extended time, use of assistive technology for writing or recording explanations.
*   **ELL Support Strategies:** Visual dictionaries for math terms (e.g., "add," "subtract," "triangle"), use of cognates (e.g., "más," "menos"), sentence frames for explaining mathematical thinking ("I know this because..."), hands-on activities that allow for demonstration of understanding without extensive language, peer pairing with bilingual students if possible.
