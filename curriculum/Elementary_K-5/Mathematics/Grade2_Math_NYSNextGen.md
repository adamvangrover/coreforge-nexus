# Grade 2 - Mathematics - NYS Next Generation Math Standards
**Note: The content herein is a proposed draft for Subject Matter Expert (SME) review and expansion. Specific NYS Learning Standards for Grade 2 need to be populated by an SME as direct online access was unavailable.**

## I. Overview and Alignment

## IV. Assessment Strategies
*   **Formative Assessments:** (Based on Grade 1, adapted for Grade 2 - SME to refine) Math journal entries with drawings and explanations, exit tickets with 1-2 problems, teacher observation of student work with manipulatives, student explanations during math talks, "show me" with whiteboards, anecdotal records during small group work, quick checks on counting, adding/subtracting.
*   **Summative Assessments:** (Based on Grade 1, adapted for Grade 2 - SME to refine) Unit tests with a mix of problem types (word problems, computation, drawing models, explaining reasoning), performance tasks (e.g., measuring objects and comparing lengths, solving multi-step money problems, building and describing arrays), student interviews to assess understanding of place value or problem-solving strategies.
*   **Accommodations & Modifications (IDEA/504):** (Standard placeholders - SME to refine for Grade 2 specifics) Use of manipulatives for all tasks, visual aids (number lines, hundreds charts, place value charts), pre-drawn templates, reduced number of problems, extended time, assistive technology.
*   **ELL Support Strategies:** (Standard placeholders - SME to refine for Grade 2 specifics) Visual dictionaries for math terms, use of cognates, sentence frames, hands-on activities, peer pairing.
