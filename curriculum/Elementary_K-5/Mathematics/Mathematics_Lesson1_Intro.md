## I. Lesson Overview

*   **Subject:** Mathematics
*   **Grade Level:** 1
*   **Topic:** Introduction to Addition (Putting Together)
*   **Estimated Duration:** 45 minutes

## II. Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

1.  Understand addition as putting together and adding to.
2.  Use concrete objects to solve simple addition problems within 10.
3.  Read and write addition equations using the plus (+) and equal (=) signs.

## III. Standards Alignment

*   **State Standards:** NY-1.OA.1: Use addition and subtraction within 20 to solve one-step word problems involving situations of adding to, taking from, putting together, taking apart, and comparing.
*   **Skill Focus:** Critical thinking, representation, and computation.

## IV. Materials Needed

*   Connecting cubes or counters (two colors)
*   Whiteboards and markers
*   "Plus" and "Equal" sign cards
*   Number cards (0-10)

## V. Lesson Procedure

### A. Introduction (5-10 minutes)

*   **Hook:** Hold up 2 red markers in one hand and 3 blue markers in the other. Ask: "How many markers do I have in this hand? How many in this one? What happens if I put them all in one big pile?"
*   **Review:** Briefly count from 1 to 20 as a class warm-up.

### B. Direct Instruction (15-20 minutes)

*   **Concept Explanation:** Introduce the word "Addition" means putting groups together to find the total.
*   **Symbol Introduction:** Show the "+" sign. Explain it acts like glue, sticking numbers together. Show the "=" sign. Explain it means "is the same as".
*   **Modeling:**
    *   Place 2 red cubes on the board. Write "2".
    *   Place 3 blue cubes next to them. Write "3".
    *   Put a "+" between them.
    *   Count them all together: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
    *   Write "= 5".
    *   Read aloud: "Two plus three equals five."

### C. Guided Practice (10 minutes)

*   **Partner Activity:**
    *   Give each pair of students a set of counters and a whiteboard.
    *   Teacher calls out a story: "I saw 4 frogs on a log. Then 2 more jumped on. How many frogs are there now?"
    *   Students use counters to show the story and write the equation on their whiteboards.
    *   Check for understanding.

### D. Independent Practice (10 minutes)

*   **Worksheet:** Students complete a worksheet where they draw circles to represent numbers and solve simple addition problems (e.g., 3 + 1 = __, 2 + 2 = __).
*   **Challenge:** Write an addition sentence for a picture of 5 apples and 3 bananas.

## VI. Assessment & Wrap-up

*   **Exit Ticket:** Solve: 4 + 1 = ? Draw a picture to show how you got your answer.
*   **Homework:** Find something in your house you can add together (e.g., forks and spoons) and draw a picture of it.
