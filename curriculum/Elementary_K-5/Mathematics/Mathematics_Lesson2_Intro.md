## I. Lesson Overview

*   **Subject:** Mathematics
*   **Grade Level:** 1
*   **Topic:** Introduction to Subtraction (Taking Away)
*   **Estimated Duration:** 45 minutes

## II. Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

1.  Understand subtraction as taking apart or taking from.
2.  Use concrete objects to solve simple subtraction problems within 10.
3.  Read and write subtraction equations using the minus (-) and equal (=) signs.

## III. Standards Alignment

*   **State Standards:** NY-1.OA.1: Use addition and subtraction within 20 to solve one-step word problems involving situations of adding to, taking from, putting together, taking apart, and comparing.
*   **Skill Focus:** Critical thinking, representation, and computation.

## IV. Materials Needed

*   Connecting cubes or counters (one color is fine)
*   Whiteboards and markers
*   "Minus" and "Equal" sign cards
*   Number cards (0-10)
*   Story problem cards

## V. Lesson Procedure

### A. Introduction (5-10 minutes)

*   **Hook:** "Yesterday we talked about putting things together (Addition). Today, we are going to talk about what happens when we take things away."
*   **Activity:** Hold up 5 fingers. "I have 5 fingers. I put 2 down. How many are left up?" Count together: 1, 2, 3.

### B. Direct Instruction (15-20 minutes)

*   **Concept Explanation:** Introduce the word "Subtraction" means taking away from a group to find what is left.
*   **Symbol Introduction:** Show the "-" sign. Explain it looks like a flat line, maybe like a knife cutting something away, or just a stick lying down. Show the "=" sign again.
*   **Modeling:**
    *   Place 5 cubes on the board. Write "5".
    *   Say "I am taking away 2." Remove 2 cubes. Write "- 2".
    *   Count how many are left: 1, 2, 3.
    *   Write "= 3".
    *   Read aloud: "Five minus two equals three."

### C. Guided Practice (10 minutes)

*   **Partner Activity:**
    *   Give each pair of students 10 counters.
    *   Teacher tells a story: "There were 6 birds on a fence. 2 flew away. How many birds are on the fence now?"
    *   Student A puts out 6 counters. Student B takes away 2. Both count what is left.
    *   They write "6 - 2 = 4" on their whiteboards.
    *   Repeat with other numbers.

### D. Independent Practice (10 minutes)

*   **Worksheet:** Students complete a worksheet where they cross out objects to solve subtraction problems (e.g., Cross out 3 apples from a group of 5).
*   **Challenge:** "If I have 10 cookies and I eat 0, how many do I have left?" (Zero property).

## VI. Assessment & Wrap-up

*   **Exit Ticket:** Solve: 5 - 1 = ? Draw a picture to show how you got your answer.
*   **Homework:** "Subtraction Hunt" - Find a situation at home where something is taken away (e.g., eating carrots) and draw it.
