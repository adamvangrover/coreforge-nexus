# Grades K-5 - Physical Education - NYS Physical Education Learning Standards
**Note: The content herein is a proposed draft for Subject Matter Expert (SME) review and expansion.**

## I. Overview and Alignment
*   **Subject Description:** Elementary Physical Education (K-5) focuses on developing fundamental motor skills and movement patterns, understanding basic movement concepts, engaging in health-enhancing physical activity, exhibiting responsible personal and social behavior, and recognizing the value of physical activity for health, enjoyment, challenge, self-expression, and social interaction. The program is designed to be inclusive, engaging, and promote a lifelong love of movement.
*   **NYS Learning Standards Addressed:** (Progressively across K-5, with increasing complexity)
    *   **Standard 1: Demonstrates competency in a variety of motor skills and movement patterns.** (e.g., K: Basic locomotor, non-locomotor, and manipulative skills. Gr 2-3: Combining skills, rhythmic activities. Gr 4-5: Refining skills in modified games and activities.)
    *   **Standard 2: Applies knowledge of concepts, principles, strategies and tactics related to movement and performance.** (e.g., K: Spatial awareness. Gr 2-3: Simple strategies in games. Gr 4-5: Applying tactics, understanding rules.)
    *   **Standard 3: Demonstrates the knowledge and skills to achieve and maintain a health-enhancing level of physical activity and fitness.** (e.g., K: Identifying physical activity. Gr 2-3: Understanding physiological responses to exercise. Gr 4-5: Components of fitness, goal setting.)
    *   **Standard 4: Exhibits responsible personal and social behavior that respects self and others.** (e.g., K: Safety, taking turns. Gr 2-3: Cooperation, following rules. Gr 4-5: Teamwork, sportsmanship, respecting differences.)
    *   **Standard 5: Recognizes the value of physical activity for health, enjoyment, challenge, self-expression and/or social interaction.** (e.g., K: Enjoyment of movement. Gr 2-3: Identifying feelings associated with activity. Gr 4-5: Choosing activities for enjoyment and challenge.)
*   **Federal Mandate Considerations (if applicable):** ESSA's focus on well-rounded education, IDEA principles for UDL ensuring inclusive participation for all learners.

## II. Core Concepts / Units (Conceptual - organized by themes across K-5, with grade-band appropriate skills)
(Logically sequenced units or major topics, progressively building skills from K to 5. Specific activities within units will vary by grade level and school resources.)

*   **Unit 1: Foundations of Movement: Locomotor & Non-Locomotor Skills**
    *   **Key Concepts (K-2):** Exploring basic locomotor skills (walk, run, hop, jump, skip, gallop, slide) and non-locomotor skills (bend, stretch, twist, turn, swing, sway). Moving safely in general and personal space.
    *   **Key Concepts (3-5):** Refining and combining locomotor skills in sequences and to rhythm. Using non-locomotor skills for balance, warm-ups, and cool-downs. Applying movement concepts (pathways, levels, speed, force).

    *   **Key Concepts (3-5):** Introduction to simple team game strategies (e.g., offense, defense, finding open space), applying rules in modified lead-up games, teamwork, communication, and problem-solving within a game context.
    *   **Learning Objectives (Proposed - examples):**
        *   (K) Students will be able to participate in a cooperative game, sharing equipment with a partner.
        *   (5th) Students will be able to explain and apply one offensive and one defensive strategy in a modified team game.
    *   **Essential Questions:** How can we play fair and have fun together? How do rules help us play games? How can working as a team help us succeed?
*   **Unit 4: My Body in Motion: Understanding Fitness and Health**
    *   **Key Concepts (K-2):** Identifying that physical activity makes our hearts beat faster and our breathing change. Recognizing activities that are good for our bodies. Understanding the importance of rest and hydration.
    *   **Key Concepts (3-5):** Introduction to health-related fitness components (cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength, muscular endurance, flexibility). Understanding that different activities improve different fitness components. Setting simple personal fitness goals.

## III. Instructional Strategies & Resources
*   **Key Pedagogical Approaches:** UDL principles, direct instruction for skill development, guided discovery, movement exploration, cooperative learning games, station work, peer teaching, positive and specific feedback, use of music, storytelling through movement, "game sense" approach for older grades.
*   **Potential Interdisciplinary Connections:** Counting repetitions/scores in Math, Learning about body systems and healthy habits in Science/Health, Cultural dances in Social Studies/Arts, Following directions in ELA, Expressing ideas through movement in Arts.
*   **Ideas for Supplemental Materials & Technology Integration:** Variety of sports equipment (balls of different sizes/textures, beanbags, scarves, hoops, jump ropes, cones, spots, low nets, paddles, modified bats/sticks), music player, parachute, tumbling mats, balance beams (low), pedometers (for older grades), videos demonstrating skills or cultural dances, interactive whiteboard for visual cues or station instructions.

## IV. Assessment Strategies
*   **Formative Assessments:** Teacher observation with skill checklists (e.g., "can hop on one foot," "throws overhand with opposition"), peer observation (with guidance), self-assessment of effort or skill attempt ("thumbs up/middle/down"), questioning during activities ("Show me how you can...", "Why is it important to...?"), exit slips (e.g., "Name one thing you learned today").
*   **Summative Assessments:** Skill performance rubrics (for specific locomotor, manipulative, or game skills at grade-appropriate levels), participation logs/journals (for older grades, focusing on effort, sportsmanship, goal setting), simple fitness challenges (e.g., how many jumps in 30 seconds, timed run for older grades - focus on improvement), presentations of student-created dances or game modifications (for older grades).
*   **Accommodations & Modifications (IDEA/504):** Modified equipment (e.g., larger/softer balls, lighter bats, lower targets), peer buddies for support, visual cues and schedules, simplified rules for games, alternative activities to meet similar skill goals, choice in activities or roles within games, breaking down skills into smaller steps, providing rest breaks.
*   **ELL Support Strategies:** Visual demonstrations of all skills and activities, use of gestures and non-verbal cues, bilingual peer partners if available, simplified verbal instructions, pre-teaching key vocabulary for games and activities (e.g., "pass," "shoot," "safe"), labeling equipment in multiple languages if feasible, positive reinforcement for participation and effort.
