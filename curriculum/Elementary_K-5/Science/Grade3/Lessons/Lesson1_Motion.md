# Lesson 1: Balanced and Unbalanced Forces

## Lesson Overview
Students will explore how pushes and pulls can change the speed or direction of an object's motion. They will distinguish between balanced forces (no change in motion) and unbalanced forces (change in motion).

## Learning Objectives
*   **Student will be able to:** Demonstrate that a force is a push or a pull.
*   **Student will be able to:** Observe and record that unbalanced forces cause changes in the motion of an object.
*   **Student will be able to:** Explain that balanced forces result in no change in motion (e.g., an object staying still).

## Standards Alignment
*   **NYSSLS 3-PS2-1:** Plan and conduct an investigation to provide evidence of the effects of balanced and unbalanced forces on the motion of an object.

## Materials Needed
*   Soccer ball or playground ball
*   Rope for tug-of-war (demonstration)
*   Toy cars
*   Science Notebooks

## Lesson Procedure

### 1. Engage (10 mins)
*   **Hook:** Place a ball in the center of the room. Ask: "Why is the ball not moving?"
*   **Discussion:** Introduce the concept of "Balanced Forces" holding it in place (gravity vs floor).
*   **Action:** Gently kick the ball. Ask: "What changed?" (A force was applied).

### 2. Explore (20 mins)
*   **Activity:** "Tug of War" Simulation.
    *   Have two students push against each other with hands (safely). If they don't move, forces are balanced.
    *   Have one push harder. They move. Unbalanced force.
*   **Investigation:** Students use toy cars. They practice applying small pushes (forces) to make them start, stop, or turn.
*   **Recording:** Students draw diagrams in notebooks using arrows to show the direction of the push or pull.

### 3. Explain (10 mins)
*   Define **Force** as a push or a pull.
*   Define **Balanced Force**: Forces that cancel each other out; object stays still or keeps moving at same speed.
*   Define **Unbalanced Force**: Forces that are stronger on one side; object changes speed or direction.

### 4. Elaborate (5 mins)
*   Ask students to identify forces in the classroom (e.g., a book sitting on a desk, a door opening).

## Assessment & Wrap-up
*   **Exit Ticket:** Draw a picture of a car speeding up. Draw an arrow to show the unbalanced force making it move.

## Accommodations & Modifications
*   **ELL:** Use sentence stems: "The ball moved because..." "The force was..."
*   **UDL:** Provide tactile arrows for students to place on objects to represent forces.
