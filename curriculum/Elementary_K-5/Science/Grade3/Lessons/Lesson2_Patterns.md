# Lesson 2: Patterns of Motion

## Lesson Overview
Students will observe objects in regular motion (pendulums, swings, bouncing balls) to identify patterns and predict future motion.

## Learning Objectives
*   **SWBAT:** Observe and record patterns in the motion of objects.
*   **SWBAT:** Predict the future motion of an object based on observed patterns.

## Standards Alignment
*   **NYSSLS 3-PS2-2:** Make observations and/or measurements of an object’s motion to provide evidence that a pattern can be used to predict future motion.

## Materials Needed
*   String and washers (to make pendulums)
*   Stopwatches
*   Metronome (optional)
*   Yo-yos

## Lesson Procedure

### 1. Engage (5 mins)
*   Show a video of a child on a swing. Ask: "If I close my eyes for 2 seconds, where will the child be? Can we guess?"

### 2. Explore (25 mins)
*   **Station 1: Pendulums.** Students pull a washer on a string back and let go. They time how long it takes to swing back and forth. Is it regular?
*   **Station 2: Bouncing Ball.** Drop a ball from a specific height. Observe the pattern of bounces (it gets lower each time, but the rhythm is predictable).
*   **Data Collection:** Students record observations in a simple table.

### 3. Explain (10 mins)
*   Discuss findings. "Did the pendulum swing the same way every time?"
*   Introduce the concept of a **Pattern**: Something that repeats.
*   Discuss how patterns help us predict. "If the swing comes back every 3 seconds, when will it be back next?"

### 4. Elaborate (5 mins)
*   Discuss real-world examples: Seasons, day/night, a clock's hands. Are these patterns of motion? (Yes, Earth's rotation).

## Assessment
*   **Formative:** Observe group discussions at stations.
*   **Wrap-up:** Ask students to predict what would happen if we made the string of the pendulum longer. (Hypothesis for next time).
