# Unit 1: Forces and Interactions

## Overview and Alignment
**NYSSLS Focus:** 3-PS2-1, 3-PS2-2, 3-PS2-3, 3-PS2-4
This unit explores the effects of balanced and unbalanced forces on the motion of objects and the patterns of an object’s motion. Students will also investigate electric and magnetic interactions between objects not in contact.

## Core Concepts
1.  **Balanced and Unbalanced Forces:** Understanding how forces affect motion.
2.  **Patterns of Motion:** Predicting future motion based on observed patterns.
3.  **Electric and Magnetic Forces:** Non-contact forces and their applications.

## Instructional Strategies & Resources
*   **Hands-on Investigations:** Students will use toy cars, magnets, and pendulums to observe forces.
*   **Engineering Design:** Design a simple problem-solving device using magnets (e.g., a magnetic latch).
*   **Phenomenon-Based Learning:** "Why does the swing keep going?" and "How do maglev trains work?"

## Assessment Strategies
*   **Formative:** Observation of student investigations, science notebook entries on force diagrams.
*   **Summative:** Performance task: Design a magnetic game or solution.
*   **Checklist:** Can the student explain cause and effect relationships in motion?

## Resources
*   Magnets (bar, horseshoe, ring)
*   Toy cars, ramps, weights
*   Spring scales
