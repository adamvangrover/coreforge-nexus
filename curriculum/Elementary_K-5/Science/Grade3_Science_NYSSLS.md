# Grade 3 - Science - NYS Science Learning Standards (NYSSLS)
**Note: The content herein is a proposed draft for Subject Matter Expert (SME) review and expansion.**

## I. Overview and Alignment
*   **Subject Description:** Third-grade science encourages students to explore concepts in life science (life cycles, traits, adaptation, fossils), earth science (weather, climate, weather hazards), and physical science (forces, motion, magnetism, static electricity). Emphasis is placed on developing science and engineering practices such as asking questions, developing models, planning and carrying out investigations, analyzing data, and constructing explanations.
*   **NYS Learning Standards Addressed:** (Performance Expectations examples)
    *   **Life Science (LS):** 3-LS1-1 (Develop models to describe that organisms have unique and diverse life cycles but all have in common birth, growth, reproduction, and death), 3-LS3-1 (Analyze and interpret data to provide evidence that plants and animals have traits inherited from parents and that variation of these traits exists in a group of similar organisms), 3-LS4-1 (Analyze and interpret data from fossils to provide evidence of the organisms and the environments in which they lived long ago), 3-LS4-3 (Construct an argument with evidence that in a particular habitat some organisms can survive well, some survive less well, and some cannot survive at all).
    *   **Earth and Space Science (ESS):** 3-ESS2-1 (Represent data in tables and graphical displays to describe typical weather conditions expected during a particular season), 3-ESS2-2 (Obtain and combine information to describe climates in different regions of the world), 3-ESS3-1 (Make a claim about the merit of a design solution that reduces the impacts of a weather-related hazard).
    *   **Physical Science (PS):** 3-PS2-1 (Plan and conduct an investigation to provide evidence of the effects of balanced and unbalanced forces on the motion of an object), 3-PS2-2 (Make observations and/or measurements of an objectâ€™s motion to provide evidence that a pattern can be used to predict future motion), 3-PS2-3 (Ask questions to determine cause and effect relationships of electric or magnetic interactions between two objects not in contact with each other).
*   **Federal Mandate Considerations (if applicable):** ESSA's focus on well-rounded education, IDEA principles for UDL ensuring access for all learners.
*   **Statutory Instructional Mandates Integrated (if applicable):** Humane treatment of animals if studying live organisms or their life cycles. Fire and Arson prevention concepts could be linked to discussions of energy or weather hazards (e.g., lightning).

## II. Core Concepts / Units
(Logically sequenced units or major topics)
*   **Unit 1: Forces and Motion: Pushes, Pulls, and Predictions**
    *   Key Concepts: Balanced and unbalanced forces, effect of forces on an object's motion (starting, stopping, changing direction, changing speed), patterns in motion (e.g., swings, rolling balls), predicting future motion based on patterns.
    *   Learning Objectives (Proposed):
        *   Students will be able to plan and conduct an investigation to show how forces affect an object's motion. (correlates with 3-PS2-1)
        *   Students will be able to observe an object's motion and identify patterns to predict its future movement. (correlates with 3-PS2-2)
    *   Essential Questions: What makes things move? How can we change how something is moving? Can we predict how something will move?
*   **Unit 2: Invisible Forces: Magnetism and Static Electricity**
    *   Key Concepts: Properties of magnets (attraction/repulsion, poles), magnetic fields (observable effects), static electricity (buildup of charge, attraction/repulsion), cause and effect relationships in electric and magnetic interactions.
    *   Learning Objectives (Proposed):
        *   Students will be able to ask questions to investigate and explain how magnets interact with each other and with different materials. (correlates with 3-PS2-3)
        *   Students will be able to conduct simple experiments to demonstrate the effects of static electricity.
    *   Essential Questions: How do magnets work even when they are not touching things? What causes static cling?
*   **Unit 3: Life's Journey: Life Cycles and Inherited Traits**
    *   Key Concepts: Diverse life cycles of plants and animals (birth, growth, reproduction, death), inherited traits from parents, variation of traits within a group of similar organisms.
    *   Learning Objectives (Proposed):
        *   Students will be able to develop and use models (e.g., diagrams, physical models) to describe the common stages and unique variations in the life cycles of different organisms. (correlates with 3-LS1-1)
        *   Students will be able to analyze and interpret data (e.g., from observations, charts) to show that traits are passed from parents to offspring and that variations exist. (correlates with 3-LS3-1)
    *   Essential Questions: How do plants and animals grow and change throughout their lives? Why do baby animals look like their parents, but not exactly the same?
*   **Unit 4: Survival in Habitats & Clues from the Past: Adaptation and Fossils**
    *   Key Concepts: Organisms have adaptations that help them survive in their specific habitats, some organisms survive better than others in a particular habitat, fossils provide evidence about ancient organisms and environments.
    *   Learning Objectives (Proposed):
        *   Students will be able to construct an argument using evidence to explain how certain traits help organisms survive well in their habitat, while others might not. (correlates with 3-LS4-3)
        *   Students will be able to analyze and interpret data from fossil images or models to describe organisms and environments of the past. (correlates with 3-LS4-1)
    *   Essential Questions: How do animals and plants survive where they live? What can fossils tell us about life long ago?
*   **Unit 5: Weather Watchers: Patterns, Climate, and Hazards**
    *   Key Concepts: Observing and recording weather conditions (temperature, precipitation, wind, cloud cover), seasonal weather patterns, climate as long-term weather patterns in a region, weather-related hazards (e.g., thunderstorms, floods, blizzards), and solutions to reduce their impact.
    *   Learning Objectives (Proposed):
        *   Students will be able to represent weather data in tables and graphs to describe typical weather for different seasons. (correlates with 3-ESS2-1)
        *   Students will be able to obtain and combine information from various sources to describe different climates around the world. (correlates with 3-ESS2-2)
        *   Students will be able to make a claim about how a design solution (e.g., strong roof, storm drains) can reduce the impact of a weather hazard. (correlates with 3-ESS3-1)
    *   Essential Questions: How does weather change from day to day and season to season? What makes the climate different in different parts of the world? How can we stay safe during severe weather?

## III. Instructional Strategies & Resources
*   **Key Pedagogical Approaches:** UDL principles, hands-on investigations (e.g., testing forces on toy cars, exploring magnets, planting seeds and observing growth, creating model habitats, building weather instruments), outdoor observations, science notebooks/journals, developing and using models, collaborative group work, class discussions, analyzing data from charts and graphs, engineering design challenges (e.g., designing a structure to withstand wind).
*   **Potential Interdisciplinary Connections:** Recording weather data and creating graphs in Math (1.MD.C.4 alignment for data representation), Reading informational texts about animals, plants, weather, and fossils in ELA (RI.3.1-RI.3.10), Writing explanations or arguments about scientific concepts in ELA (W.3.1, W.3.2), Researching climates of different regions in Social Studies.
*   **Ideas for Supplemental Materials & Technology Integration:** Magnifying glasses, magnets, iron filings, balloons, various materials for testing forces (ramps, toy cars, blocks), terrariums/aquariums (optional, for observing organisms), seeds, soil, pots, thermometers, rain gauges, anemometers (simple versions), fossil collections or replicas, weather maps, science journals, age-appropriate websites with science simulations or videos (e.g., Mystery Science, PBS Kids science content - for review), interactive whiteboard activities.

## IV. Assessment Strategies
*   **Formative Assessments:** Science notebook entries (observations, drawings, data, reflections), class participation in discussions, exit tickets with concept checks, labeled diagrams (e.g., life cycle, parts of a plant), "think-pair-share" responses to questions, teacher observation of students during investigations (using checklists for science practices).
*   **Summative Assessments:** Investigation reports where students plan, conduct, and explain findings; creating models (e.g., a diorama of a habitat with adapted organisms, a model of a life cycle, a design for a weather-resistant structure); presentations explaining a scientific concept or the results of an investigation; written explanations or arguments supported by evidence.
*   **Accommodations & Modifications (IDEA/504):** Visual instructions for experiments, pre-drawn templates for recording data or observations, sentence starters for writing explanations, use of assistive technology for writing or drawing, reduced number of variables in investigations, choice of how to present findings (e.g., oral report, poster).
*   **ELL Support Strategies:** Visual aids for scientific vocabulary and phenomena (pictures, diagrams, realia), bilingual glossaries, hands-on activities that allow for demonstration of understanding with minimal language, sentence frames for scientific explanations ("I observed...", "The evidence shows..."), cooperative learning groups with supportive peers, using gestures and modeling during instructions.
