# Grade 4 Science Course Overview

## Overview and Alignment
The Grade 4 Science curriculum focuses on Energy, Waves, Earth's Systems, and Structure/Function of organisms. It aligns with NYSSLS (New York State Science Learning Standards) for 4th Grade.

## Core Units
1.  **Energy:** Speed, collisions, energy transfer (sound, light, heat, electric).
2.  **Waves:** Amplitude and wavelength, information transfer.
3.  **Structure and Function:** Internal and external structures of plants and animals.
4.  **Earth's Systems:** Rock formations, erosion, plate tectonics (patterns), and natural hazards.

## Instructional Strategies
*   **Engineering Design:** Students will design solutions to problems (e.g., preventing erosion, protecting from earthquake damage).
*   **Modeling:** Developing models of waves and energy transfer.

## Assessment Strategies
*   Performance Tasks (Engineering Builds)
*   Science Notebooks
*   Unit Quizzes

## Compliance
*   **Part 100.4:** Meets the requirement for science instruction in intermediate grades.
