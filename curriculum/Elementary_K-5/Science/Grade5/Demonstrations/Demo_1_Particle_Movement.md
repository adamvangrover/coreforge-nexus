# Demonstration: Particle Movement & Temperature

## Overview
This teacher-led demonstration visually shows how temperature affects the speed of particle movement using food coloring and water.

## Materials
* 3 clear beakers or glasses
* Cold water (ice water with ice removed)
* Room temperature water
* Hot water (near boiling)
* Food coloring (Red and Blue ideally, or just one dark color)

## Procedure

1. **Setup**:
   * Place the three beakers in a row where students can see them clearly.
   * Fill Beaker A with **Cold Water**.
   * Fill Beaker B with **Room Temp Water**.
   * Fill Beaker C with **Hot Water**.
   * Let the water settle for a moment so it is not swirling from the pour.

2. **Prediction**:
   * Ask students: *"If I drop food coloring into the water, will it spread faster in the hot water or the cold water? Why?"*

3. **Action**:
   * Simultaneously drop 2 drops of food coloring into each beaker. Do not stir!

4. **Observation**:
   * Watch how the color spreads (diffuses).
   * **Hot Water**: The color should spread rapidly and swirl on its own.
   * **Cold Water**: The color will streak down and settle at the bottom, spreading very slowly.
   * **Room Temp**: Somewhere in between.

## Discussion Points
* **Kinetic Energy**: Hot water particles have more energy and are moving faster. They bump into the food coloring particles more often and harder, pushing them around quickly.
* **Cold Particles**: Move slowly, so they don't mix the dye as fast.
* **Analogy**: Compare it to a crowded room. If everyone is running (hot), you get bumped around a lot. If everyone is standing still or walking slowly (cold), you don't move much.
