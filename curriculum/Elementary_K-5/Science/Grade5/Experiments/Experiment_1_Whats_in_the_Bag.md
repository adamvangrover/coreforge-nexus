# Experiment: What's in the Bag?

## Overview
In this investigation, students will mix mysterious substances in a sealed plastic bag and observe the resulting chemical and physical changes. This lab aligns with the NYS required investigation.

## Learning Objectives
* Students will observe and record signs of chemical reactions (color change, gas production, temperature change).
* Students will differentiate between physical and chemical changes.

## Materials Needed
* Gallon-sized Ziploc freezer bags
* Calcium Chloride (Road salt pellets) - 1 spoonful
* Baking Soda (Sodium Bicarbonate) - 1 spoonful
* Phenol Red indicator solution (or diluted cabbage juice) - 30ml
* Small medicine cup or film canister
* Safety goggles
* Thermometer (optional)

## Safety Precautions
* **Wear safety goggles at all times.**
* Do not eat or drink any materials.
* Wash hands thoroughly after the experiment.
* If the bag gets too hot or looks like it might burst, place it in the sink immediately.

## Procedure

1. **Observation of Reactants**:
   * Examine the Calcium Chloride and Baking Soda. Record observations (color, texture, state of matter).
   * Examine the Phenol Red solution. Record observations.

2. **Setup**:
   * Open the Ziploc bag.
   * Add 1 spoonful of Baking Soda to one corner.
   * Add 1 spoonful of Calcium Chloride to the other corner. **Do not mix them yet.**
   * Pour 30ml of Phenol Red into the small cup.
   * Carefully place the cup inside the bag, standing it upright so it does not spill.
   * Squeeze as much air out of the bag as possible and seal it tightly.

3. **Reaction**:
   * Tip the cup over inside the sealed bag to spill the liquid.
   * Mix everything together by gently kneading the bag from the outside.
   * **Observe!** Look for color changes, bubbles, and feel the bag for temperature changes.

## Data Collection

| Observation Type | Description of What Happened |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Visual (Sight)** | *e.g., Did the color change? Did bubbles form?* |
| **Tactile (Touch)** | *e.g., Did the bag get hot or cold? Did it expand?* |
| **Auditory (Sound)** | *e.g., Did you hear fizzing?* |

## Analysis Questions

1. What evidence indicates that a chemical reaction took place?
2. The bag inflated. What state of matter was produced to cause this?
3. Did the temperature change? If so, did it get hot (exothermic) or cold (endothermic)?
4. If you weighed the bag before and after the reaction (without opening it), would the weight change? Explain why or why not.

## Teacher Notes / Science Behind It
* **Chemical Reaction**: $NaHCO_3$ (Baking Soda) + $CaCl_2$ (Calcium Chloride) + Phenol Red $\rightarrow$ $CO_2$ (Gas) + $CaCO_3$ (Precipitate) + Heat + Color Change.
* The Phenol Red turns yellow indicating an acidic environment due to $CO_2$.
* The reaction releases heat (exothermic).
