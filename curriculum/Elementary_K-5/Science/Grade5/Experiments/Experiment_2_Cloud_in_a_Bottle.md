# Experiment: Cloud in a Bottle

## Overview
Students will create a cloud inside a bottle to understand the conditions necessary for cloud formation: water vapor, cooling, and condensation nuclei (particles). This aligns with the NYS required investigation.

## Learning Objectives
* Students will model the water cycle and cloud formation.
* Students will understand the role of pressure and temperature in condensation.

## Materials Needed
* 1-liter clear plastic bottle with cap (label removed)
* Warm water
* Matches (Teacher use only) OR Aerosol spray (like hairspray)
* Strip thermometer (optional, to tape inside bottle)

## Safety Precautions
* **Teacher supervision required** for use of matches.
* Be careful with warm water.

## Procedure

1. **Preparation**:
   * Pour a small amount of warm water (about 20-30ml) into the bottle.
   * Screw the cap on and shake it to coat the sides. This increases the water vapor inside.

2. **The "Clear" Attempt**:
   * Squeeze the bottle hard and then release.
   * Observe: Does a cloud form? (Likely not, or very faint).

3. **Adding Particles (The Nuclei)**:
   * Open the cap.
   * **Teacher Step**: Light a match, let it burn for a second, blow it out, and quickly drop the smoking match into the bottle. Alternatively, spray a quick burst of hairspray into the bottle.
   * Quickly screw the cap back on tight.

4. **Making the Cloud**:
   * Squeeze the bottle hard (High Pressure). *Hold it.*
   * Release the bottle quickly (Low Pressure).
   * **Observe!** A white cloud should instantly appear when you release.
   * Squeeze again. The cloud disappears.
   * Release again. The cloud reappears.

## Data Analysis

1. **Draw a Diagram**: Draw the bottle when squeezed (clear) and released (cloudy).
2. **Explain**:
   * What did the smoke/hairspray represent in the real atmosphere? (Dust/Pollen/Particles).
   * What happened to the temperature when you released the bottle (low pressure)? (It cooled down).
   * Why did water appear as a cloud? (Vapor turned into liquid droplets).

## Conclusion
Clouds form when invisible water vapor in the air cools down and condenses onto tiny floating particles like dust or smoke. High pressure warms the air (clearing clouds), and low pressure cools the air (forming clouds).
