# Experiment: Circle of Life (Decomposition)

## Overview
Students will build a mini-composter to observe how decomposers break down organic matter into soil. This aligns with NYS required investigations.

## Learning Objectives
* Students will identify the role of decomposers in an ecosystem.
* Students will observe the cycling of matter from dead organisms to soil.

## Materials Needed
* 2-liter clear plastic bottle (top cut off)
* Soil
* Fruit/Vegetable scraps (apple cores, lettuce)
* Dried leaves/Newspaper
* Water spray bottle
* Plastic wrap and rubber band
* Earthworms (optional but recommended)

## Procedure
1. **Prepare the Container**: Cut the top off a clear plastic bottle.
2. **Layering**:
   * Add a layer of soil at the bottom.
   * Add a layer of organic scraps (food).
   * Add a layer of dried leaves or shredded newspaper.
   * Repeat until the bottle is nearly full.
3. **Moisture**: Spray with water until moist but not soaking.
4. **Decomposers**: Add earthworms if using.
5. **Seal**: Cover with plastic wrap and poke small holes for air. Secure with a rubber band.
6. **Observation**: Keep in a warm, dark place. Observe weekly for 4 weeks.

## Observations
* **Week 1**:
* **Week 2**:
* **Week 3**:
* **Week 4**:

## Analysis
1. How did the food scraps change over time?
2. What role did the soil/worms play?
3. Why is decomposition important for an ecosystem?
