# Grade 5 Science Curriculum Map: Strategic Sequencing

This curriculum map organizes the Grade 5 Science content into four strategic phases, designed to align with seasonal constraints, developmental readiness, and the New York State "Unit of Study" requirements (180 minutes/week).

## Time Allocation Guide (Part 100 Compliance)

| Component | Frequency | Duration | Weekly Total | Annual Est. |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Direct Lesson | 3x / week | 45 min | 135 min | 81 hours |
| Lab/Investigation | 1x / week | 60 min | 60 min | 36 hours |
| Independent Practice | Daily | 15 min | 75 min | 45 hours |
| **TOTAL** | | | **270 min** | **162 hours** |

*Note: The weekly total of 270 minutes exceeds the 180-minute minimum, providing a buffer for assemblies, testing, and holidays.*

## Phase 1: The Concrete World (September - November)
**Focus:** Unit 1: Structure and Properties of Matter
**Rationale:** Fifth graders benefit from starting with concrete, tangible experiences. Manipulating solids and liquids builds confidence in Science and Engineering Practices (measuring, observing) before moving to abstract concepts.

*   **Week 1-2:** Defining Matter & The Particle Model (Zooming In)
*   **Week 3:** Investigation Prep: Safety in the Lab
*   **Week 4:** Conservation of Mass: Weighing the Mixture
*   **Week 5-6:** **Required Investigation: What's in the Bag?** (Chemical Reactions)
*   **Week 7-8:** Distinguishing Physical vs. Chemical Changes
*   **Week 9:** Unit 1 Assessment & Performance Task

## Phase 2: The Energy Bridge (December - January)
**Focus:** Unit 4: Space Systems & Integrated Energy
**Rationale:** As winter sets in, outdoor investigations become difficult. This is the optimal time for "Light It Up" (Energy/Circuits) which creates engagement during the darker months, and Space Systems which explore light and shadows.

*   **Week 10:** What is Energy? Forms and Transfer.
*   **Week 11:** Transferring Energy: Electric Circuits.
*   **Week 12:** **Required Investigation: Light It Up** (Design a System).
*   **Week 13:** Engineering Challenge: Design a Flashlight.
*   **Week 14:** Gravity: The Invisible Pull (5-PS2-1).
*   **Week 15:** Shadows and Day/Night Cycles.
*   **Week 16:** Stars and the Solar System.

## Phase 3: Systems and Cycles (February - April)
**Focus:** Unit 3: Earth’s Systems and Human Impact
**Rationale:** Spring weather provides the dynamic backdrop for studying the atmosphere and water cycle.

*   **Week 17:** The Four Spheres: A System Approach.
*   **Week 18:** Water Distribution: Graphing the Ocean (Math Connection).
*   **Week 19:** The Atmosphere and Weather Patterns.
*   **Week 20:** **Required Investigation: Cloud in a Bottle**.
*   **Week 21:** Human Impact: Protecting Our Resources (5-ESS3-1).
*   **Week 22:** Unit 3 Assessment: Modeling Earth's Systems.

## Phase 4: Life in Action (May - June)
**Focus:** Unit 2: Matter and Energy in Ecosystems
**Rationale:** The return of plant life allows for direct observation of photosynthesis and food webs.

*   **Week 23:** Setup **Required Investigation: Circle of Life** (Longitudinal Start).
*   **Week 24:** Plant Needs: Air and Water (5-LS1-1).
*   **Week 25:** Food Webs: Tracing the Sun's Energy.
*   **Week 26:** Decomposers: Nature's Recyclers.
*   **Week 27-29:** Ongoing Observation & Analysis of "Circle of Life".
*   **Week 30:** Final Performance Task: The Ecosystem Model.
