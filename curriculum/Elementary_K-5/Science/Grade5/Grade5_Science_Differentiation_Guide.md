# Grade 5 Science: Differentiation & Accessibility Guide

This guide provides specific strategies for adapting the CoreForge Nexus curriculum to meet the needs of diverse learners, aligning with UDL principles and NYS Part 154 regulations.

## Universal Design for Learning (UDL)

### 1. Multiple Means of Representation (The "What")
*   **Visual Anchors:** Every unit should start with a "Word Wall" including images (e.g., a photo of a melting ice cube next to the word "Physical Change").
*   **Digital Text:** Use tools like Kami or Google Read&Write to allow text-to-speech for all articles.
*   **Simulation:** Use PhET simulations for abstract concepts (Particles, Gravity). Allow students to play with the variables before defining them.

### 2. Multiple Means of Action & Expression (The "How")
*   **Choice Boards:** For assessments, offer 3 modes:
    *   *Write it:* Standard paragraph/CER.
    *   *Draw it:* labeled diagram with captions.
    *   *Say it:* Record a 30-second Flip/Flipgrid video explanation.
*   **Scribe/Dictation:** Allow students with fine motor difficulties to dictate observations to a partner or software.

### 3. Multiple Means of Engagement (The "Why")
*   **Phenomena-First:** Always start with a mystery ("Why did the bag explode?") rather than definitions.
*   **Culturally Responsive Teaching:** Connect water scarcity (Unit 3) to students' heritage countries or local community issues.

## English Language Learners (ELL / MLL)

### Scaffolding Strategies
*   **Sentence Stems:** Provide non-negotiable stems for scientific talk.
    *   *Observation:* "I noticed that..."
    *   *Hypothesis:* "I think ____ will happen because ____."
    *   *Argument:* "My evidence is..."
*   **Cognates:** Highlight words that share roots with Spanish/French/Haitian Creole.
    *   *Precipitation / Precipitación*
    *   *Gravity / Gravedad*
    *   *Observe / Observar*
    *   *Solid / Sólido*
*   **Total Physical Response (TPR):** Use hand gestures.
    *   *Gas:* Wiggle fingers high in the air.
    *   *Solid:* Clench fists tight together.

## Special Education (IDEA / IEP)

### Common Accommodations
*   **Chunking:** Break the "Lesson Procedure" into checklist steps. "Do Step 1. Check box. Show teacher."
*   **Graphic Organizers:** Never ask for a blank page summary. Provide a "Fill-in-the-blank" frame or a T-Chart.
*   **Manipulatives:** In Math connections (Graphing water), use physical cubes to represent percentages before drawing bars.
*   **Pre-teaching:** Pull a small group 5 minutes before the lesson to preview the 3 key vocabulary words of the day.

## Advanced Learners (Extension)

*   **Engineering Challenges:** "You finished the circuit? Now make it have two switches."
*   **Inquiry Leader:** Assign them as "Materials Manager" or "Safety Inspector" for their group.
*   **Research:** "Find out why Mars doesn't have liquid water and report back."
