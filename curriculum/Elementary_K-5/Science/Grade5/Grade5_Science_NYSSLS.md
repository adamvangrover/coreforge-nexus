Grade 5 - Science - NYSSLS
Note: The content herein is a proposed draft for Subject Matter Expert (SME) review.

I. Overview and Alignment
- **Subject Description**: A comprehensive Grade 5 science curriculum aligned to NYSSLS standards. Covers scientific practices, matter, energy, earth systems, ecosystems, and engineering. Designed for 180 instructional days using inquiry-based and UDL-aligned pedagogy.
- **NYS Learning Standards Addressed**: NYSSLS (New York State Science Learning Standards) including 5-PS1, 5-PS2, 5-PS3, 5-LS2, 5-ESS2, 5-ESS3, and 5-ETS1.
- **Federal Mandate Considerations**: Compliant with ESSA (Every Student Succeeds Act) requirements for rigorous science instruction.
- **Statutory Instructional Mandates**: Includes laboratory requirements and engineering design integration.

II. Core Concepts / Units

**Unit 1: Scientific Inquiry & Practices**
- **Big Ideas**: Science relies on asking questions, conducting investigations, and using models to explain phenomena.
- **Essential Questions**: How do scientists investigate the world? Why are models important in science?
- **Lessons Included**: Lessons 1-3

**Unit 2: Structure and Properties of Matter**
- **Big Ideas**: Matter is made of particles and changes can conserve or alter its structure.
- **Essential Questions**: How does matter change? What properties define materials?
- **Lessons Included**: Lessons 4-7

**Unit 3: Energy and Motion**
- **Big Ideas**: Energy changes form and affects motion.
- **Essential Questions**: How does energy move through systems? How do forces influence motion?
- **Lessons Included**: Lessons 8-10

**Unit 4: Earth Systems & Weather**
- **Big Ideas**: Earth systems interact and shape weather, climate, and natural events.
- **Essential Questions**: How do Earth’s systems interact? What causes natural hazards?
- **Lessons Included**: Lessons 11-14

**Unit 5: Ecosystems and Interdependence**
- **Big Ideas**: Living organisms depend on each other for energy and survival.
- **Essential Questions**: How does energy flow in ecosystems? How do organisms survive?
- **Lessons Included**: Lessons 15-18

**Unit 6: Engineering and Capstone STEM Design**
- **Big Ideas**: Engineering uses science to solve real-world problems.
- **Essential Questions**: How can we solve problems using science? How do we test and improve designs?
- **Lessons Included**: Lessons 19-20

III. Instructional Strategies & Resources
- **Pedagogical Model**: Inquiry-based learning, Phenomena-driven instruction, Universal Design for Learning (UDL), and hands-on laboratory experiences.
- **Interdisciplinary Connections**: ELA (informational text reading/writing), Mathematics (measurement, data analysis).
- **Digital + Physical Resources**: Lab safety equipment, measurement tools, digital simulations, modeling kits, science journals.

IV. Assessment Strategies
- **Formative Strategies**: Exit tickets, observation rubrics, science journal entries, quick sorts, concept maps.
- **Summative Strategies**: Performance tasks, lab reports, unit quizzes, capstone design projects.
- **Accommodations (IDEA/504)**: Visual aids, graphic organizers, text-to-speech, simplified instructions, extended time.
- **ELL Strategies**: Vocabulary banks, sentence frames, visual glossaries, peer partnering.
