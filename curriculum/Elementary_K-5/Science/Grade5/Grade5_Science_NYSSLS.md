# Grade 5 Science Course Overview: CoreForge Nexus

## I. Overview and Alignment

**Regulatory Compliance (Part 100.4 & 100.5):**
This curriculum is designed to meet the New York State Commissioner’s Regulations requiring a minimum of 180 minutes of instruction per week (or 108 hours per year) for science at the intermediate level. While the default lesson block is set to 45 minutes, the curriculum assumes a flexible delivery model where instructional time is aggregated to meet the 900-hour annual requirement for Grades K-6. Instruction includes direct teaching, laboratory investigations, and independent practice.

**Pedagogical Framework (NYSSLS & 3D Learning):**
The course is built upon the New York State P-12 Science Learning Standards (NYSSLS), leveraging "Three-Dimensional Learning" which intertwines:
*   **Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCIs):** Physical, Life, Earth & Space Sciences, and Engineering.
*   **Science and Engineering Practices (SEPs):** Modeling, investigating, and arguing from evidence.
*   **Crosscutting Concepts (CCCs):** Patterns, systems, and energy/matter flows.

**Mandated Investigations:**
This course explicitly schedules the four required laboratory investigations for Grade 5, which are statutory prerequisites for the Elementary-level Science Test:
1.  *Cloud in a Bottle* (Weather and Climate)
2.  *Light It Up* (Energy and Circuits)
3.  *Circle of Life* (Life Cycles and Traits)
4.  *What's in the Bag?* (Structure and Properties of Matter)

**Federal Mandates (ESSA & IDEA):**
Aligned with the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), this curriculum incorporates Universal Design for Learning (UDL) principles to ensure equitable access. All content is designed to support students with disabilities in accordance with IDEA, utilizing multi-modal representations and flexible assessment strategies.

## II. Core Concepts / Units

### Unit 1: Structure and Properties of Matter
*   **Standards:** 5-PS1-1 through 5-PS1-4
*   **Key Concepts:**
    *   **The Particle Nature of Matter:** Understanding that matter is made of particles too small to be seen (5-PS1-1).
    *   **Conservation of Mass:** Matter is neither created nor destroyed during phase changes or mixtures (5-PS1-2).
    *   **Chemical Reactions:** Identifying new substances based on property changes (5-PS1-4).
*   **Mandated Investigation:** *What's in the Bag?* - A "Fair Test" investigation mixing reactants (baking soda, calcium chloride, phenol red) to observe chemical changes and confirm conservation of mass.
*   **Essential Questions:**
    *   If we can't see the particles, how do we know they are there?
    *   Where does the matter go when it dissolves?
    *   How can we tell if a new substance is created?

### Unit 2: Matter and Energy in Ecosystems
*   **Standards:** 5-LS1-1, 5-LS2-1, 5-PS3-1
*   **Key Concepts:**
    *   **Plant Growth:** Plants acquire material primarily from air and water, not soil (5-LS1-1).
    *   **Energy Flow:** Tracing energy from the sun to plants and then to animals (5-PS3-1).
    *   **Decomposition:** The recycling of dead organisms.
*   **Mandated Investigation:** *Circle of Life* - A longitudinal study of organism life cycles and their role in the ecosystem's energy and matter cycles.
*   **Essential Questions:**
    *   How does the sun's energy get into a hamburger?
    *   Do plants need soil to gain weight?
    *   How does nature recycle dead organisms?

### Unit 3: Earth’s Systems and Human Impact
*   **Standards:** 5-ESS2-1, 5-ESS2-2, 5-ESS3-1
*   **Key Concepts:**
    *   **The Four Spheres:** Interactions between geosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere.
    *   **Water Distribution:** Describing and graphing the scarcity of fresh water versus salt water.
*   **Mandated Investigation:** *Cloud in a Bottle* - Modeling the interaction of the hydrosphere, atmosphere, and geosphere (nuclei) to form clouds.
*   **Essential Questions:**
    *   How does a change in the atmosphere affect the biosphere?
    *   If Earth is "the water planet," why is fresh water so scarce?

### Unit 4: Space Systems: Stars and the Solar System
*   **Standards:** 5-PS2-1, 5-ESS1-1, 5-ESS1-2
*   **Key Concepts:**
    *   **Gravity:** The direction of Earth's gravitational force (5-PS2-1).
    *   **Patterns in Space:** Shadows, day/night cycles, and seasonal star visibility (5-ESS1-2).
    *   **Stellar Brightness:** The sun appears brighter due to proximity (5-ESS1-1).
*   **Mandated Investigation:** *Light It Up* - (Note: Often linked to Energy/Circuits 4-PS3 but positioned here or in an integrated Energy module). Focuses on designing systems (circuits) to transfer energy.
*   **Essential Questions:**
    *   Why do shadows get longer in the winter?
    *   Why does the sun look so much brighter than other stars?
    *   What keeps us on the ground?

## III. Instructional Strategies & Resources

**Universal Design for Learning (UDL):**
*   **Multiple Means of Representation:** Text-to-speech options, visual particle models (5-PS1-1), and digital simulations (PhET) alongside physical manipulatives.
*   **Multiple Means of Action and Expression:** Options for students to demonstrate learning via oral defense, model building, or written argumentation.
*   **Multiple Means of Engagement:** Use of culturally relevant phenomena and "Exploding Lunch Bag" style hooks.

**Support for English Language Learners (Part 154):**
*   **Vocabulary:** Explicit instruction on Tier 2 (academic) and Tier 3 (domain-specific) words.
*   **Scaffolding:** Use of sentence stems ("I claim that... because...") for scientific argumentation.
*   **Cognates:** highlighting connections (e.g., precipitation/precipitacion) for Spanish speakers.

**Resources:**
*   **Physical:** 1-liter bottles, matches, calcium chloride, baking soda, batteries, bulbs, alligator clips.
*   **Digital:** Virtual lab simulations for particle modeling.

## IV. Assessment Strategies

*   **Performance Tasks:** Lab execution rubrics (planning, conducting, analyzing).
*   **Formative Assessment:** Exit tickets assessing specific DCIs (e.g., distinguishing physical vs. chemical changes).
*   **Summative Assessment:** Unit exams and the NYS Elementary-level Science Test eligibility checks (completion of investigations).
*   **Accommodations:** Alternative testing environments, tactile labeling for circuit components, and extended time as per IEPs.
