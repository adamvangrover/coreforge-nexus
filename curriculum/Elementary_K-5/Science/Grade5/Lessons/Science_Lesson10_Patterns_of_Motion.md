title: Science Lesson 10: Patterns of Motion
grade_level: "5"
subject: "Science"

I. Lesson Overview
- **Subject**: Science
- **Grade Level**: 5
- **Topic**: Patterns of Motion (Speed & Velocity)
- **Duration**: 45 Minutes

II. Learning Objectives
1. Analyze patterns of motion to predict future motion.
2. Differentiate between speed (how fast) and direction.
3. Solve simple motion problems.

III. Standards Alignment
- **NYSSLS Standard Codes**: 5-PS2-1
- **Skill Focus**: Analyzing and interpreting data.

IV. Materials Needed
- Stopwatches
- Meter sticks
- "Motion Story Problem" worksheet
- Playground balls

V. Lesson Procedure

A. Introduction (5–10 min)
- **Hook**: Watch a pendulum swing. "Can you guess where it will be in 2 seconds?"
- **Prior knowledge activation**: Review forces from previous lesson.

B. Direct Instruction (15–20 min)
- **Explanation**: Discuss that motion often follows patterns (e.g., swinging, spinning, rolling). Introduce Speed = Distance / Time.
- **Models/examples**: A carousel (spinning pattern). A swing (back and forth).
- **Academic vocabulary**: Pattern, Speed, Direction, Prediction, Periodic Motion.

C. Guided Practice (10 min)
- **Structured group activity**: "Predict the Path". Roll a ball back and forth between partners. Change the speed. Partners try to predict when the ball will arrive.

D. Independent Practice (10 min)
- **Individual task**: "Motion Story Problem". Read short scenarios (e.g., "A train travels straight at high speed...") and draw the path or predict what happens next.

VI. Assessment & Wrap Up
- **Exit ticket**: "If I swing on a swing set, is my motion random or a pattern? Why?"
- **Formative checks**: Review story problem answers.

VII. Differentiation & Supports
- **SPED / IDEA accommodations**: Use video clips of motion patterns instead of live demos if tracking is difficult.
- **ELL strategies**: Use terms "Fast/Slow" and "Straight/Curved" alongside academic terms.
- **Advanced learner extensions**: Calculate the speed of the rolling ball in the guided practice (cm per second).
