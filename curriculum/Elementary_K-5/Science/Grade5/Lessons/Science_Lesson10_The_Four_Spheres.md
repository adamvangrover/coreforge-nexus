# Lesson 10: The Four Spheres

## I. Lesson Overview
*   **Topic:** Earth's Systems Interactions (5-ESS2-1)
*   **Context:** This lesson introduces the vocabulary and concept of Earth as a complex system of interacting parts.
*   **Pacing:** Week 17 (February)
*   **Duration:** 60 Minutes

## II. Learning Objectives
*   Students will define the Geosphere, Biosphere, Hydrosphere, and Atmosphere.
*   Students will identify interactions between these spheres in a given scenario (e.g., rain falling on a mountain).

## III. Standards Alignment
*   **5-ESS2-1:** Develop a model using an example to describe ways the geosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and/or atmosphere interact.
*   **SEP:** Developing and Using Models.
*   **CCC:** Systems and System Models.

## IV. Materials Needed
*   **Visuals:** Photos of landscapes (Ocean, Forest, Desert, City).
*   **Worksheet:** "Sphere Interaction Web."

## V. Lesson Procedure

### A. Introduction (Hook) - 10 Minutes
*   **Photo Analysis:** Show a picture of a thunderstorm over a forest.
*   **List:** "List everything you see." (Trees, Rain, Clouds, Dirt, Lightning).
*   **Group:** Can we group these?

### B. Direct Instruction - 15 Minutes
*   **The Four Spheres:**
    *   **Geosphere:** "Geo" = Earth. Rocks, soil, mountains, sand.
    *   **Hydrosphere:** "Hydro" = Water. Oceans, lakes, rivers, ice.
    *   **Atmosphere:** "Atmo" = Air. The gas envelope around Earth.
    *   **Biosphere:** "Bio" = Life. Plants, animals, bacteria, humans.
*   **Interaction:** When rain (Hydro) falls on dirt (Geo) and helps a plant (Bio) grow, that is an interaction.

### C. Guided Practice - 20 Minutes
*   **Scenario Cards:** Read a card, students identify the spheres.
    *   *Card:* "A volcano erupts, spewing ash into the air."
    *   *Answer:* Geosphere (Volcano) -> Atmosphere (Air).
    *   *Card:* "A deer drinks from a stream."
    *   *Answer:* Biosphere (Deer) -> Hydrosphere (Stream).

### D. Independent Practice - 15 Minutes
*   **System Drawing:** Draw a scene near your school. Label at least one item for each sphere. Draw arrows showing how they touch or help each other.

## VI. Assessment & Wrap-up
*   **Exit Ticket:** "A worm digs a tunnel in the soil. Which two spheres are interacting?" (Biosphere and Geosphere).

## VII. Resources & References
*   NASA "Earth System Science" Module.
