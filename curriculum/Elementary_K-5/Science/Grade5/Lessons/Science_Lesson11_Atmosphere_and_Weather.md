# Lesson 11: Atmosphere & Weather Patterns

## I. Lesson Overview
*   **Topic:** Weather vs. Climate (Support for 5-ESS2-1)
*   **Context:** Prepares students for the "Cloud in a Bottle" lab by exploring what makes weather happen (Air masses).
*   **Pacing:** Week 19 (March)
*   **Duration:** 60 Minutes

## II. Learning Objectives
*   Students will distinguish between weather (short-term) and climate (long-term).
*   Students will analyze weather maps to predict local conditions based on fronts.

## III. Standards Alignment
*   **5-ESS2-1:** Develop a model to describe ways the... atmosphere interact.
*   **SEP:** Analyzing and Interpreting Data.
*   **CCC:** Patterns.

## IV. Materials Needed
*   **Data:** Local weather forecast for the week.
*   **Maps:** Current US Weather Map (showing H/L pressure and fronts).

## V. Lesson Procedure

### A. Introduction (Hook) - 10 Minutes
*   **The Outfit Game:** Teacher describes a scenario. Students vote on the outfit.
    *   "It's sunny and 85 degrees." (Shorts).
    *   "It usually rains in April." (Raincoat).
*   **Concept:** Weather is what you get. Climate is what you expect.

### B. Direct Instruction - 15 Minutes
*   **Ingredients of Weather:** Temperature, Humidity, Air Pressure, Wind.
*   **Air Pressure:** High Pressure (H) = Happy weather (Sunny/Clear). Low Pressure (L) = Lousy weather (Cloudy/Stormy).
*   **Connection:** Remember this for next week's cloud lab! Low pressure makes clouds.

### C. Guided Practice (Forecast) - 20 Minutes
*   **Map Reading:** Look at a US map. Find the "L".
*   **Prediction:** "Chicago has an 'L' over it. What is the weather like there?" (Rainy/Cloudy).
*   **Prediction:** "Miami has an 'H'. What is the weather?" (Sunny).

### D. Independent Practice - 15 Minutes
*   **Data Table:** Look at a 30-year average rainfall chart (Climate) vs. yesterday's rainfall (Weather). Circle which is which.
*   **Writing:** "Why can it snow on a day in Spring if the climate is usually warm?" (Weather varies day to day).

## VI. Assessment & Wrap-up
*   **Exit Ticket:** "Is 'It rained on Tuesday' an example of Weather or Climate?"

## VII. Resources & References
*   National Weather Service (NWS) JetStream.
