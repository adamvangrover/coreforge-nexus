I. Lesson Overview
- **Subject**: Science
- **Grade Level**: 5
- **Topic**: Earth’s Systems (Geosphere, Biosphere, Hydrosphere, Atmosphere)
- **Duration**: 45 Minutes

II. Learning Objectives
1. Identify and describe the four major Earth systems.
2. Explain how these systems interact with each other.
3. Classify elements of nature into the correct system.

III. Standards Alignment
- **NYSSLS Standard Codes**: 5-ESS2-1
- **Skill Focus**: Developing and using models.

IV. Materials Needed
- "Earth Systems" diagram
- Sorting cards (clouds, rocks, trees, river, etc.)
- Colored pencils
- Science journals

V. Lesson Procedure

A. Introduction (5–10 min)
- **Hook**: Show a picture of a beach. "I see water, sand, air, and seagulls. How are they connected?"
- **Prior knowledge activation**: Review basic geography terms.

B. Direct Instruction (15–20 min)
- **Explanation**: Define the four "spheres": Geosphere (land/rock), Hydrosphere (water), Atmosphere (air), Biosphere (life).
- **Models/examples**: Rain (Hydro) falling on Soil (Geo) helping a Plant (Bio) grow.
- **Academic vocabulary**: Geosphere, Hydrosphere, Atmosphere, Biosphere, Interaction.

C. Guided Practice (10 min)
- **Structured group activity**: "System Sort". Groups sort cards into the 4 spheres. Then, they draw lines connecting cards that interact (e.g., Bird nests in Tree).

D. Independent Practice (10 min)
- **Individual task**: "My Local System". Students draw a scene from their neighborhood and label at least one item from each sphere.

VI. Assessment & Wrap Up
- **Exit ticket**: "Which sphere does a cloud belong to?" (Atmosphere/Hydrosphere - discuss overlap).
- **Formative checks**: Check sorting accuracy.

VII. Differentiation & Supports
- **SPED / IDEA accommodations**: Color-coded system mats for sorting.
- **ELL strategies**: Cognate connections (Hydro=Water, Bio=Life, Atmo=Vapor/Air).
- **Advanced learner extensions**: Discuss the "Cryosphere" (ice) as a subsystem of the hydrosphere.
