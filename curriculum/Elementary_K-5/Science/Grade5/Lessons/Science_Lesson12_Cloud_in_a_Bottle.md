# Lesson 12: Cloud in a Bottle (Earth's Spheres)

## I. Lesson Overview
*   **Topic:** Interactions of Earth's Spheres (5-ESS2-1)
*   **Context:** Students model how the atmosphere and hydrosphere interact to create weather. This is the mandated "Cloud in a Bottle" investigation.
*   **Duration:** 60 Minutes

## II. Learning Objectives
*   Students will model the formation of clouds using water, pressure change, and condensation nuclei.
*   Students will identify the interactions between the Atmosphere, Hydrosphere, and Geosphere in the model.

## III. Standards Alignment
*   **5-ESS2-1:** Develop a model using an example to describe ways the geosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and/or atmosphere interact.
*   **SEP:** Developing and Using Models.
*   **CCC:** Systems and System Models.

## IV. Materials Needed
*   **Materials:** 1-liter clear plastic bottles (with caps), warm water, matches (teacher use only for smoke) OR rubbing alcohol (alternative), foot pump with valve cap (optional for high pressure).

## V. Lesson Procedure

### A. Introduction (Hook) - 10 Minutes
*   **Visual:** Show a time-lapse video of cloud formation.
*   **Question:** "Are clouds gas or liquid?"
*   **Misconception Alert:** Many students think clouds are water vapor (gas). Explain that water vapor is invisible; clouds are liquid droplets or ice crystals.

### B. Direct Instruction - 10 Minutes
*   **The Recipe for a Cloud:**
    1.  **Water Vapor** (Hydrosphere -> Atmosphere)
    2.  **Cooling** (Low Pressure)
    3.  **Cloud Seeds** (Condensation Nuclei/Dust - Geosphere)
*   **System Model:** Explain that the bottle is a closed system representing our planet's atmosphere.

### C. Guided Practice (The Investigation) - 30 Minutes
*   **Teacher Role:** Light a match, blow it out, and trap the smoke in the bottle (adding "Dust/Geosphere").
*   **Student Role:** Add a small amount of warm water ("Hydrosphere"). Cap the bottle.
*   **Action:** Squeeze the bottle hard (High Pressure = Clear/Warm). Release the bottle quickly (Low Pressure = Cooling).
*   **Observation:** A cloud forms instantly upon release!
*   **Repeat:** Squeeze again -> Cloud disappears. Release -> Cloud reappears.
*   **Discussion:** Why does squeezing make it disappear? (Pressure warms the air, evaporating the droplets back to gas).

### D. Independent Practice - 10 Minutes
*   **Diagram:** Students draw the bottle system and label the "Spheres."
    *   Water = Hydrosphere
    *   Air = Atmosphere
    *   Smoke = Geosphere interaction
*   **Debrief:** Connect the bottle model to real-world weather fronts (Low pressure systems bring clouds/rain).

## VI. Assessment & Wrap-up
*   **Exit Ticket:** "Explain why we needed the smoke (dust) to make the cloud form. Which sphere does the smoke represent?"
*   **Differentiation:**
    *   *Support:* Provide a labeled diagram for students to color-code.
    *   *Extension:* Research how pollution (too much geosphere/anthroposphere) affects cloud formation (smog).
