I. Lesson Overview
- **Subject**: Science
- **Grade Level**: 5
- **Topic**: Water Cycle & Weather
- **Duration**: 45 Minutes

II. Learning Objectives
1. Describe the stages of the water cycle: evaporation, condensation, precipitation.
2. Explain the role of the sun in driving the water cycle.
3. Relate the water cycle to local weather patterns.

III. Standards Alignment
- **NYSSLS Standard Codes**: 5-ESS2-1
- **Skill Focus**: Developing and using models.

IV. Materials Needed
- Ziplock bag, water, blue food coloring (for window bag model)
- Heat lamp (Sun model)
- "Water Cycle" diagram
- Cotton balls (clouds)

V. Lesson Procedure

A. Introduction (5–10 min)
- **Hook**: "Where does a puddle go when it dries up?"
- **Prior knowledge activation**: Review states of matter (Lesson 4).

B. Direct Instruction (15–20 min)
- **Explanation**: Walk through the cycle. Sun heats water -> Evaporation (gas). Cools high up -> Condensation (cloud). Gets heavy -> Precipitation (rain/snow). Collection.
- **Models/examples**: Boiling kettle steam (Evaporation). Cold soda can sweating (Condensation).
- **Academic vocabulary**: Evaporation, Condensation, Precipitation, Collection, Solar Energy.

C. Guided Practice (10 min)
- **Structured group activity**: "Make a Mini-Water Cycle". Draw a sun and clouds on a ziplock bag. Add a little blue water. Tape to a sunny window. Observe over time (condensation will form).

D. Independent Practice (10 min)
- **Individual task**: Label the "Water Cycle Diagram" and write one sentence explaining the sun's job.

VI. Assessment & Wrap Up
- **Exit ticket**: "What step forms clouds?"
- **Formative checks**: Review labeled diagrams.

VII. Differentiation & Supports
- **SPED / IDEA accommodations**: Cut-and-paste labels for the diagram.
- **ELL strategies**: Water cycle song or chant with hand motions.
- **Advanced learner extensions**: Investigate transpiration (plants releasing water).
