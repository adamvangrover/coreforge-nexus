I. Lesson Overview
- **Subject**: Science
- **Grade Level**: 5
- **Topic**: Climate vs Weather
- **Duration**: 45 Minutes

II. Learning Objectives
1. Distinguish between weather (short-term) and climate (long-term).
2. Analyze data to describe climate patterns.
3. Identify different climate zones.

III. Standards Alignment
- **NYSSLS Standard Codes**: 5-ESS2-1, 5-ESS3-1
- **Skill Focus**: Analyzing and interpreting data.

IV. Materials Needed
- "Wardrobe Sorting" game (clothes for different weather)
- Climate maps
- Local weather data charts
- Science journals

V. Lesson Procedure

A. Introduction (5–10 min)
- **Hook**: "If I say it's raining right now, is that weather or climate? If I say it usually snows in January, is that weather or climate?"
- **Prior knowledge activation**: Review weather terms.

B. Direct Instruction (15–20 min)
- **Explanation**: Weather = Conditions of the atmosphere right now (or short term). Climate = Average weather over many years (30+ years).
- **Models/examples**: "Weather is your mood; Climate is your personality."
- **Academic vocabulary**: Weather, Climate, Data, Average, Pattern.

C. Guided Practice (10 min)
- **Structured group activity**: "Scenario Sort". Read cards: "It rained on Tuesday" (Weather). "The desert is always dry" (Climate). Sort into two piles.

D. Independent Practice (10 min)
- **Individual task**: "Pack Your Bags". Choose a destination (e.g., Alaska). Write down what to pack based on its CLIMATE, not just today's weather.

VI. Assessment & Wrap Up
- **Exit ticket**: "Give one example of a climate statement."
- **Formative checks**: Monitor sorting activity.

VII. Differentiation & Supports
- **SPED / IDEA accommodations**: Visual cues on cards (calendar icon for long-term, clock for short-term).
- **ELL strategies**: Use map legends to explain climate zones visually.
- **Advanced learner extensions**: Analyze climate change graphs.
