# Lesson 13: Water Distribution (Graphing the Earth)

## I. Lesson Overview
*   **Topic:** Water Distribution (5-ESS2-2)
*   **Context:** We call Earth the "Blue Planet," but how much of that water can we actually drink? This lesson integrates Math (graphing) with Earth Science.
*   **Pacing:** Week 18 (March)
*   **Duration:** 60 Minutes

## II. Learning Objectives
*   Students will describe and graph the amounts of salt water vs. fresh water on Earth.
*   Students will identify glaciers and groundwater as the primary reservoirs of fresh water.

## III. Standards Alignment
*   **5-ESS2-2:** Describe and graph the amounts and percentages of water and fresh water in various reservoirs...
*   **SEP:** Using Mathematics and Computational Thinking.
*   **CCC:** Scale, Proportion, and Quantity.
*   **Math Connection:** 5.G.2 (Graphing).

## IV. Materials Needed
*   **Demo:** 1 Liter of water, salt, eye dropper, small cup.
*   **Worksheet:** "Water Distribution Circle Graph."

## V. Lesson Procedure

### A. Introduction (Hook) - 10 Minutes
*   **The 1000mL Demo:** Fill a 1L cylinder with blue water. "This is all the water on Earth."
*   **Ask:** "How much is fresh water?"
*   **Reveal:** Pour out only 30mL (3%). "This is fresh water." The rest (970mL) is salty ocean.
*   **Zoom In:** Take 20mL of the fresh water and freeze it (symbolically). "This is ice."
*   **The Drop:** Take the last drop. "This is the water in rivers and lakes that we can easily use."

### B. Direct Instruction - 15 Minutes
*   **The Breakdown:**
    *   Oceans: 97% (Salt)
    *   Fresh Water: 3%
        *   Glaciers/Ice Caps: ~69% of fresh.
        *   Groundwater: ~30% of fresh.
        *   Surface Water (Lakes/Rivers): ~1% of fresh.

### C. Guided Practice (Graphing) - 20 Minutes
*   **Bar Graph:** Create a bar graph.
    *   Bar 1: Total Water (Split into 97 Ocean / 3 Fresh).
    *   Bar 2: Fresh Water (Split into 69 Ice / 30 Ground / 1 Surface).
*   **Discussion:** Why is it important to conserve water if the ocean is full? (Because we can't drink salt water easily).

### D. Independent Practice - 15 Minutes
*   **Interpretation:** Look at a map of a desert. Where do they get water? (Groundwater/Aquifers).
*   **Reflection:** Write a PSA slogan about saving water based on the data.

## VI. Assessment & Wrap-up
*   **Exit Ticket:** "Most of Earth's fresh water is found in ________." (Glaciers/Ice).

## VII. Resources & References
*   USGS Water Science School.
