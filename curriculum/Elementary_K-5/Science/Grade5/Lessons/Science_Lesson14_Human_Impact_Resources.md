# Lesson 14: Human Impact & Resource Protection

## I. Lesson Overview
*   **Topic:** Protecting Earth's Resources (5-ESS3-1)
*   **Context:** Following the water unit, students explore how human activities affect the spheres and how we can use science to protect them.
*   **Pacing:** Week 21 (April)
*   **Duration:** 60 Minutes

## II. Learning Objectives
*   Students will obtain and combine information about ways communities use science to protect resources.
*   Students will identify positive and negative human impacts on the environment.

## III. Standards Alignment
*   **5-ESS3-1:** Obtain and combine information about ways individual communities use science ideas to protect the Earth’s resources and environment.
*   **SEP:** Obtaining, Evaluating, and Communicating Information.
*   **CCC:** Systems and System Models.

## IV. Materials Needed
*   **Texts:** Articles about recycling, wind farms, water treatment, and vertical farming.
*   **Media:** Video on "The Great Pacific Garbage Patch" vs. "Ocean Cleanup Project."

## V. Lesson Procedure

### A. Introduction (Hook) - 10 Minutes
*   **Trash Audit:** Dump the classroom trash can (safely) onto a tarp.
*   **Analyze:** What is in here? Paper? Plastic? Food? Where does it go? (Landfill).
*   **Question:** How does a landfill affect the Geosphere and Hydrosphere? (Leaking into soil/water).

### B. Direct Instruction - 15 Minutes
*   **The Problem:** Pollution, Overuse of water, Deforestation.
*   **The Science Solution:**
    *   **Recycling:** Using chemistry to melt plastic into new things.
    *   **Renewable Energy:** Using wind/sun instead of coal (protects Atmosphere).
    *   **Conservation:** Drip irrigation (protects Hydrosphere).

### C. Guided Practice (Research Jigsaw) - 20 Minutes
*   **Groups:** Each group reads a short text about a solution (e.g., "Rooftop Gardens").
*   **Task:** Answer 3 questions:
    1.  What is the problem?
    2.  How does science help?
    3.  Which spheres are protected?
*   **Share:** Present to the class.

### D. Independent Practice - 15 Minutes
*   **Poster Design:** Design a poster for the school.
*   **Topic:** "Science Saves the Earth."
*   **Requirement:** Must show a specific solution (like "Turn off the water while brushing teeth") and explain *why* it helps.

## VI. Assessment & Wrap-up
*   **Exit Ticket:** "Name one way science helps us protect the air (Atmosphere)." (Solar power, electric cars, planting trees).

## VII. Resources & References
*   EPA "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle" for Kids.
