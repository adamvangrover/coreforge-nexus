I. Lesson Overview
- **Subject**: Science
- **Grade Level**: 5
- **Topic**: Natural Hazards
- **Duration**: 45 Minutes

II. Learning Objectives
1. Identify types of natural hazards (earthquakes, floods, hurricanes).
2. Explain the causes of specific natural hazards.
3. Discuss ways humans can prepare for and reduce the impact of these hazards.

III. Standards Alignment
- **NYSSLS Standard Codes**: 5-ESS3-1
- **Skill Focus**: Obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information.

IV. Materials Needed
- Images of natural hazards
- "Disaster Prep" checklists
- Library books or tablets for research
- Chart paper

V. Lesson Procedure

A. Introduction (5–10 min)
- **Hook**: Show a picture of a house on stilts. "Why was it built this way?" (Flood protection).
- **Prior knowledge activation**: Ask if anyone has experienced a big storm.

B. Direct Instruction (15–20 min)
- **Explanation**: Define Natural Hazard. Categorize them: Geological (Earthquake, Volcano), Weather (Hurricane, Tornado, Flood).
- **Models/examples**: Discuss local hazards (e.g., blizzards in NY, hurricanes on coast).
- **Academic vocabulary**: Hazard, Impact, Preparation, Mitigation, Engineer.

C. Guided Practice (10 min)
- **Structured group activity**: "Hazard Match". Match the hazard to the solution. (Flood -> Levee/Stilts. Earthquake -> Flexible building. Tornado -> Basement).

D. Independent Practice (10 min)
- **Individual task**: "Safety Plan". Choose one hazard. Write/draw 3 things you would put in a safety kit.

VI. Assessment & Wrap Up
- **Exit ticket**: "Name one way engineers help protect people from floods."
- **Formative checks**: Review safety plans.

VII. Differentiation & Supports
- **SPED / IDEA accommodations**: Picture menu of safety items to cut and paste into the kit.
- **ELL strategies**: Use news clips (video) to show hazards rather than just text.
- **Advanced learner extensions**: Research "Tsunami Warning Systems".
