I. Lesson Overview
- **Subject**: Science
- **Grade Level**: 5
- **Topic**: Energy in Ecosystems
- **Duration**: 45 Minutes

II. Learning Objectives
1. Explain that energy in ecosystems originates from the sun.
2. Trace the flow of energy from producers to consumers.
3. Identify herbivores, carnivores, and omnivores.

III. Standards Alignment
- **NYSSLS Standard Codes**: 5-PS3-1, 5-LS2-1
- **Skill Focus**: Developing and using models.

IV. Materials Needed
- Picture cards (Sun, Grass, Rabbit, Fox)
- Yarn or string
- "Energy Pyramid" worksheet
- Scissors/Glue

V. Lesson Procedure

A. Introduction (5–10 min)
- **Hook**: "What did you eat for breakfast? Where did that food get its energy?" Trace it back to a plant, then the sun.
- **Prior knowledge activation**: Review "Energy" from Unit 3.

B. Direct Instruction (15–20 min)
- **Explanation**: Sun is the source. Producers (Plants) make food. Consumers (Animals) eat food. Decomposers break down waste.
- **Models/examples**: Food Chain: Sun -> Corn -> Chicken -> Human.
- **Academic vocabulary**: Ecosystem, Producer, Consumer, Decomposer, Photosynthesis (basic concept).

C. Guided Practice (10 min)
- **Structured group activity**: "Living Food Chain". Students hold cards. Use yarn to connect Sun to Plant, Plant to Herbivore, etc. visualizing the energy path.

D. Independent Practice (10 min)
- **Individual task**: "Chain Construction". Cut and paste images to create a logical food chain in their journal, adding arrows for energy flow.

VI. Assessment & Wrap Up
- **Exit ticket**: "Where do plants get their energy?"
- **Formative checks**: Review food chain logic.

VII. Differentiation & Supports
- **SPED / IDEA accommodations**: Numbered cards to help order the chain (1-Sun, 2-Plant...).
- **ELL strategies**: Color-code Producers (Green) and Consumers (Red).
- **Advanced learner extensions**: Discuss energy loss at each level (10% rule simplified).
