# Lesson 15: Plant Needs (Air & Water)

## I. Lesson Overview
*   **Topic:** Plant Growth and Material Source (5-LS1-1)
*   **Context:** This lesson tackles the major misconception that plants "eat" soil. It provides the evidence needed for the "Circle of Life" investigation analysis.
*   **Pacing:** Week 24 (May)
*   **Duration:** 60 Minutes

## II. Learning Objectives
*   Students will support an argument that plants get the materials they need for growth chiefly from air and water.
*   Students will analyze historical data (Van Helmont's experiment) as evidence.

## III. Standards Alignment
*   **5-LS1-1:** Support an argument that plants get the materials they need for growth chiefly from air and water.
*   **SEP:** Engaging in Argument from Evidence.
*   **CCC:** Energy and Matter.

## IV. Materials Needed
*   **Visuals:** Diagram of Photosynthesis.
*   **Text:** Story of Jan Baptist van Helmont.
*   **Demo:** A small plant and a big bag of dirt.

## V. Lesson Procedure

### A. Introduction (Hook) - 10 Minutes
*   **The Tree Puzzle:** Show a picture of a giant Redwood tree.
*   **Ask:** "Where did all that wood come from? It weighs tons!"
*   **Poll:** A) The Soil, B) The Water, C) The Air, D) The Sun.
*   **Result:** Most students say A (Soil).

### B. Direct Instruction (Van Helmont) - 20 Minutes
*   **Storytime:** Tell the story of Van Helmont (1600s).
    *   He weighed a willow tree (5 lbs) and dry soil (200 lbs).
    *   He watered it for 5 years.
    *   The tree grew to 169 lbs (+164 lbs).
    *   The soil weighed 199.8 lbs (-0.2 lbs).
*   **Analysis:** If the tree ate the soil, the soil should be gone! But the soil is still there.
*   **Conclusion:** The mass came from the WATER (which he added) and the AIR (Carbon Dioxide).

### C. Guided Practice (The Equation) - 15 Minutes
*   **Photosynthesis:** Write the simple formula.
    *   $CO_2$ (Air) + $H_2O$ (Water) + Sun Energy -> Sugar (Food) + $O_2$ (Oxygen).
*   **Matter vs. Energy:** The Sun provides the *energy* to cook, but the Air and Water provide the *stuff* (ingredients).

### D. Independent Practice (Argument) - 15 Minutes
*   **Writing Task:** "Your friend says, 'Trees eat dirt.' Write a letter correcting them using Van Helmont's evidence."
*   **Key Points:** Mention the soil weight didn't change much. Mention where the mass actually comes from.

## VI. Assessment & Wrap-up
*   **Exit Ticket:** "True or False: Plants need soil to gain weight." (False - Hydroponics proves this!).

## VII. Resources & References
*   Project Learning Tree.
