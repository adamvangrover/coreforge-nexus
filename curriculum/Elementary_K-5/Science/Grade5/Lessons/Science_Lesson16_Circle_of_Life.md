# Lesson 16: Circle of Life (Food Webs & Cycles)

## I. Lesson Overview
*   **Topic:** Interdependent Relationships in Ecosystems (5-LS2-1)
*   **Context:** This lesson introduces the longitudinal "Circle of Life" investigation. Students set up an observation of an organism's life cycle and place it within a food web model.
*   **Duration:** 60 Minutes (Setup) + Ongoing Observations

## II. Learning Objectives
*   Students will set up a habitat for a living organism (e.g., mealworms or fast plants) to observe growth and development.
*   Students will develop a model describing the movement of matter among plants, animals, decomposers, and the environment.

## III. Standards Alignment
*   **5-LS2-1:** Develop a model to describe the movement of matter among plants, animals, decomposers, and the environment.
*   **5-PS3-1:** Use models to describe that energy in animals’ food was once energy from the sun.
*   **SEP:** Developing and Using Models.

## IV. Materials Needed
*   **Organisms:** Mealworms (Darkling Beetle larvae) OR Wisconsin Fast Plants.
*   **Habitat:** Plastic cups/containers, bran/oatmeal (food), potato slice (water source) OR soil/wicks/lights.
*   **Logs:** "Circle of Life" Observation Journals.

## V. Lesson Procedure

### A. Introduction (Hook) - 10 Minutes
*   **Mystery Item:** Show a picture of a "alien-looking" creature (zoomed in mealworm or seed pod).
*   **Question:** "What does this need to survive? Where does it get its energy?"
*   **Concept:** All living things are connected in a cycle of matter and energy.

### B. Direct Instruction - 15 Minutes
*   **The Food Web:** Draw the Sun -> Producer -> Consumer -> Decomposer chain.
*   **Decomposers:** Highlight their special role (Nature's Recyclers). Without them, dead matter would pile up and nutrients wouldn't return to the soil.
*   **The Investigation:** Explain that we will watch a creature change forms (metamorphosis or germination) and track its needs.

### C. Guided Practice (Setup) - 25 Minutes
*   **Habitat Creation:** Students work in groups to prepare the habitat.
    *   *Mealworms:* Add bran bedding, place mealworm, add potato slice.
    *   *Plants:* Wicking system setup, planting seeds, placing under lights.
*   **Initial Observation:** Students measure length/height, count segments/leaves, and draw the organism in their journal.
*   **Prediction:** "What will this look like in 2 weeks? In 4 weeks?"

### D. Independent Practice - 10 Minutes
*   **Modeling:** Students draw a "System Model" of the habitat.
    *   Arrows showing Energy In (Food/Sun).
    *   Arrows showing Matter In (Water/Air).
    *   Arrows showing Matter Out (Waste/Growth).

## VI. Assessment & Wrap-up
*   **Longitudinal Plan:** Explain that we will check these every Friday for 15 minutes.
*   **Exit Ticket:** "Where did your organism get the energy to move or grow today?" (Answer: From the bran/food or stored seed energy/sun).
