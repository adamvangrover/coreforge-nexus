I. Lesson Overview
- **Subject**: Science
- **Grade Level**: 5
- **Topic**: Food Webs
- **Duration**: 45 Minutes

II. Learning Objectives
1. Construct a food web to show multiple feeding relationships.
2. Explain organism interdependence within an ecosystem.
3. Predict the effect of removing one organism from the web.

III. Standards Alignment
- **NYSSLS Standard Codes**: 5-LS2-1
- **Skill Focus**: Developing and using models.

IV. Materials Needed
- Large poster paper
- Marker sets
- Animal/Plant image sets
- Glue sticks

V. Lesson Procedure

A. Introduction (5–10 min)
- **Hook**: "What happens if a rabbit eats grass, but a hawk eats the rabbit? And a snake also eats the rabbit?" Show complexity.
- **Prior knowledge activation**: Review Food Chains.

B. Direct Instruction (15–20 min)
- **Explanation**: Define Food Web (interconnected food chains). Emphasize Interdependence: if one thing changes, it affects others.
- **Models/examples**: Show a forest food web diagram. Trace multiple paths.
- **Academic vocabulary**: Food Web, Interdependence, Predator, Prey, Population.

C. Guided Practice (10 min)
- **Structured group activity**: "Web Weavers". Groups paste images on poster paper. They draw arrows connecting all possible eaters and eaten. Challenge: "What if the frogs die out?" Discuss impacts.

D. Independent Practice (10 min)
- **Individual task**: "Web Analysis". Look at a provided food web. Answer questions: "Name two things the owl eats." "What competes with the snake for food?"

VI. Assessment & Wrap Up
- **Exit ticket**: "Why is a food web a better model than a food chain?"
- **Formative checks**: Observation of group discussions on impacts.

VII. Differentiation & Supports
- **SPED / IDEA accommodations**: Limit the number of organisms in the web to 5-6 key species.
- **ELL strategies**: Use "eats" and "is eaten by" sentence strips.
- **Advanced learner extensions**: Introduce an invasive species to the web and predict results.
