# Lesson 17: Food Webs & Decomposers

## I. Lesson Overview
*   **Topic:** Energy Flow in Ecosystems (5-PS3-1, 5-LS2-1)
*   **Context:** Building on the "Circle of Life," students map out complex interactions.
*   **Pacing:** Week 25-26 (May)
*   **Duration:** 60 Minutes

## II. Learning Objectives
*   Students will develop a model (food web) describing the movement of matter among producers, consumers, decomposers, and the environment.
*   Students will trace the energy in a consumer back to the Sun.

## III. Standards Alignment
*   **5-PS3-1:** Use models to describe that energy in animals’ food... was once energy from the sun.
*   **5-LS2-1:** Develop a model to describe the movement of matter...
*   **SEP:** Developing and Using Models.
*   **CCC:** Systems and System Models.

## IV. Materials Needed
*   **Cards:** Organism cards (Sun, Grass, Rabbit, Fox, Hawk, Mushroom, Worm).
*   **String:** Yarn (to connect the web).
*   **Activity:** "Web of Life" game.

## V. Lesson Procedure

### A. Introduction (Hook) - 10 Minutes
*   **What did you eat?** Ask a student. "A burger."
*   **Trace it:** Burger -> Cow -> Grass -> Sun.
*   **Concept:** You are eating sunshine!

### B. Direct Instruction - 15 Minutes
*   **Vocabulary:**
    *   **Producer:** Makes food from sun (Plants).
    *   **Consumer:** Eaters (Herbivores, Carnivores).
    *   **Decomposer:** Recyclers (Fungi, Bacteria, Worms).
    *   **Apex Predator:** Top of the chain.
*   **The Arrows:** Arrows show "Energy Flow" (Where the energy goes). Point FROM the eaten TO the eater.

### C. Guided Practice (The Yarn Web) - 20 Minutes
*   **Circle Up:** Assign each student an organism card.
*   **Start:** Give the ball of yarn to the Sun.
*   **Pass:** Sun passes to Grass. Grass passes to Rabbit. Rabbit passes to Fox. Fox dies -> Passes to Mushroom (Decomposer).
*   **Complexity:** One plant feeds many animals. The web gets messy!
*   **Disruption:** "The farmer sprays poison and kills the bugs." Drop the yarn. Watch the web collapse.

### D. Independent Practice - 15 Minutes
*   **Drawing:** Draw a food web for a forest.
    *   Must include: Sun, 2 Producers, 2 Primary Consumers, 1 Secondary Consumer, 1 Decomposer.
    *   Label the arrows "Energy."

## VI. Assessment & Wrap-up
*   **Exit Ticket:** "Why are decomposers important? What would happen if they disappeared?" (Dead stuff would pile up, no nutrients for plants).

## VII. Resources & References
*   NYS DEC Environmental Education.
