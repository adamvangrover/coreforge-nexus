I. Lesson Overview
- **Subject**: Science
- **Grade Level**: 5
- **Topic**: Human Impact on Ecosystems
- **Duration**: 45 Minutes

II. Learning Objectives
1. Identify positive and negative ways humans affect the environment.
2. Analyze the impact of activities like farming, industry, and conservation.
3. Propose solutions to reduce negative impacts.

III. Standards Alignment
- **NYSSLS Standard Codes**: 5-ESS3-1
- **Skill Focus**: Obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information.

IV. Materials Needed
- "Before and After" photos of environments
- Impact Scenario Cards
- Chart paper ("Help" vs "Harm")
- Sticky notes

V. Lesson Procedure

A. Introduction (5–10 min)
- **Hook**: Show a picture of a park filled with trash vs. clean. "How did this happen?"
- **Prior knowledge activation**: Discuss "Leave No Trace" principles if known.

B. Direct Instruction (15–20 min)
- **Explanation**: Discuss Human Impact. Negative: Pollution, Deforestation, Overfishing. Positive: Recycling, Planting trees, Protected parks.
- **Models/examples**: The Lorax (brief concept reference) or local conservation efforts.
- **Academic vocabulary**: Impact, Pollution, Conservation, Agriculture, Sustainability.

C. Guided Practice (10 min)
- **Structured group activity**: "Impact Sort". Read scenario cards (e.g., "Building a new mall"). Place on "Help" or "Harm" chart. Discuss nuances (mall provides jobs but takes habitat).

D. Independent Practice (10 min)
- **Individual task**: "Eco-solution". Pick one negative impact (e.g., plastic in ocean). Write/Draw one way to help fix it.

VI. Assessment & Wrap Up
- **Exit ticket**: "Name one way you can help the environment at home."
- **Formative checks**: Review proposed solutions.

VII. Differentiation & Supports
- **SPED / IDEA accommodations**: Provide a list of solution options to choose from.
- **ELL strategies**: Use "Sad Earth / Happy Earth" visuals for sorting.
- **Advanced learner extensions**: Research a specific environmental law.

VIII. Resources & References
- Unit 5 Overview
- Lesson 14 (Natural Hazards - similar theme of protection)
