I. Lesson Overview
- **Subject**: Science
- **Grade Level**: 5
- **Topic**: Adaptations and Survival
- **Duration**: 45 Minutes

II. Learning Objectives
1. Define adaptation as a trait that helps an organism survive.
2. Differentiate between physical (body) and behavioral (action) adaptations.
3. Explain how adaptations relate to an organism's specific habitat.

III. Standards Alignment
- **NYSSLS Standard Codes**: 5-LS2-1 (Context for survival)
- **Skill Focus**: Engaging in argument from evidence.

IV. Materials Needed
- Pictures of animals with distinct features (Camel, Polar Bear, Chameleon)
- "Design a Creature" worksheet
- Coloring supplies

V. Lesson Procedure

A. Introduction (5–10 min)
- **Hook**: "Why don't polar bears live in the desert?"
- **Prior knowledge activation**: Review habitats.

B. Direct Instruction (15–20 min)
- **Explanation**: Define Adaptation. Physical: Fur, claws, camouflage. Behavioral: Migration, hibernation, hunting in packs.
- **Models/examples**: Giraffe's long neck (reach food). Frog's sticky tongue (catch bugs).
- **Academic vocabulary**: Adaptation, Trait, Survival, Physical, Behavioral.

C. Guided Practice (10 min)
- **Structured group activity**: "Adaptation Match". Match the animal to its feature and the function. (Duck -> Webbed Feet -> Swimming).

D. Independent Practice (10 min)
- **Individual task**: "Creature Feature". Given a specific habitat (e.g., a cold, dark cave), draw a made-up animal with 3 adaptations to survive there. Label them.

VI. Assessment & Wrap Up
- **Exit ticket**: "Is a bird migrating south physical or behavioral?" (Behavioral).
- **Formative checks**: Evaluate creature designs for logical connection to habitat.

VII. Differentiation & Supports
- **SPED / IDEA accommodations**: Pre-drawn animal outlines to add features to.
- **ELL strategies**: Gestures for "Physical" (touch arm) and "Behavioral" (act out sleeping/running).
- **Advanced learner extensions**: Discuss how adaptations change over very long periods (introduction to evolution concepts).
