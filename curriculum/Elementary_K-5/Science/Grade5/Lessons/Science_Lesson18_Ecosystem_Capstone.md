# Lesson 18: Ecosystem Model Capstone

## I. Lesson Overview
*   **Topic:** Final Performance Task (Unit 2 & 3 Integration)
*   **Context:** This is the culminating project for the year. Students synthesize their knowledge of Matter, Energy, Spheres, and Life to build a functioning model.
*   **Pacing:** Week 30 (June)
*   **Duration:** 120 Minutes (2-3 Class Periods)

## II. Learning Objectives
*   Students will design and build a model ecosystem (Terrarium/Aquarium) demonstrating the needs of living things and sphere interactions.
*   Students will present their model explaining the flow of energy and cycling of matter.

## III. Standards Alignment
*   **5-LS2-1:** Develop a model to describe the movement of matter...
*   **5-ESS2-1:** Interactions of spheres.
*   **SEP:** Developing and Using Models.

## IV. Materials Needed
*   **Construction:** Shoeboxes (Diorama) OR 2-Liter Bottles (Eco-Columns).
*   **Art Supplies:** Clay, paint, craft sticks.
*   **Real Materials:** Soil, seeds, water, rocks.

## V. Lesson Procedure

### Part 1: Design (Day 1)
*   **Challenge:** "Design a habitat for a fictional creature."
*   **Requirements:**
    1.  Source of Energy (Sun).
    2.  Producers (Plants).
    3.  Consumers (The creature).
    4.  Water Source (Hydrosphere).
    5.  Shelter (Geosphere).
*   **Blueprint:** Draw the plan and list materials.

### Part 2: Build (Day 2)
*   **Construction:** Students build their dioramas or eco-columns.
*   **Labeling:** Students must use "flag labels" for: "Producer," "Consumer," "Decomposer," "Interaction."

### Part 3: Present (Day 3)
*   **Gallery Walk:** Students walk around and critique models.
*   **Presentation:** "In my ecosystem, the 'Glurp' eats the 'Purple Moss'. The moss gets energy from the Red Sun. When the Glurp dies, the 'Slime Mold' recycles it."
