I. Lesson Overview
- **Subject**: Science
- **Grade Level**: 5
- **Topic**: Engineering Design Process
- **Duration**: 45 Minutes

II. Learning Objectives
1. Identify the steps of the Engineering Design Process (Ask, Imagine, Plan, Create, Improve).
2. Distinguish between criteria (what it must do) and constraints (limits).
3. Apply the process to a simple classroom challenge.

III. Standards Alignment
- **NYSSLS Standard Codes**: 5-ETS1-1
- **Skill Focus**: Asking questions and defining problems.

IV. Materials Needed
- "Design Cycle" poster
- Building materials (straws, tape, paper, clips)
- "Tower Challenge" prompt

V. Lesson Procedure

A. Introduction (5–10 min)
- **Hook**: Show a picture of a bridge. "How did they know it wouldn't fall down?"
- **Prior knowledge activation**: Review "Scientists ask questions, Engineers solve problems."

B. Direct Instruction (15–20 min)
- **Explanation**: Walk through the Cycle: Ask (Define problem), Imagine (Brainstorm), Plan (Draw), Create (Build), Improve (Test & Fix).
- **Models/examples**: Designing a better lunchbox. Criteria: Holds sandwich. Constraint: Fits in backpack.
- **Academic vocabulary**: Engineering, Design Process, Criteria, Constraints, Prototype.

C. Guided Practice (10 min)
- **Structured group activity**: "Rapid Prototype". Groups have 5 minutes to build the tallest tower using only index cards.

D. Independent Practice (10 min)
- **Individual task**: "Reflection". Sketch the tower. Write one thing that worked and one thing to improve next time.

VI. Assessment & Wrap Up
- **Exit ticket**: "What is the step after 'Create'?" (Improve/Test).
- **Formative checks**: Monitor group collaboration.

VII. Differentiation & Supports
- **SPED / IDEA accommodations**: Visual checklist of the steps to follow.
- **ELL strategies**: Color-coded steps (Red=Stop/Think, Green=Go/Build).
- **Advanced learner extensions**: Add a budget constraint (each card costs $1).
