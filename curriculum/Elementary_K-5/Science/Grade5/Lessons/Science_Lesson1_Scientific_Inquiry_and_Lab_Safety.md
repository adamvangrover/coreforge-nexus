I. Lesson Overview
- **Subject**: Science
- **Grade Level**: 5
- **Topic**: Scientific Inquiry & Lab Safety
- **Duration**: 45 Minutes

II. Learning Objectives
1. Identify key lab safety rules and explain their importance.
2. Understand the steps of a scientific investigation.
3. Apply safety expectations to hypothetical scenarios.

III. Standards Alignment
- **NYSSLS Standard Codes**: 5-ETS1-1
- **Skill Focus**: Asking questions, defining problems, planning investigations.

IV. Materials Needed
- Lab safety posters
- Safety contract handouts
- "Safety Scenario" cards
- Science journals
- Pens/Pencils

V. Lesson Procedure

A. Introduction (5–10 min)
- **Hook**: Discuss "What do scientists do?" and show a picture of a messy/dangerous lab vs. a safe one.
- **Prior knowledge activation**: Ask students if they have ever done an experiment and what rules they followed.

B. Direct Instruction (15–20 min)
- **Explanation**: Walk through the standard lab safety rules (eye protection, no eating, handling materials).
- **Models/examples**: Explain the Scientific Inquiry Cycle (Question, Hypothesis, Experiment, Data, Conclusion).
- **Academic vocabulary**: Inquiry, Hypothesis, Variable, Procedure, Hazard.

C. Guided Practice (10 min)
- **Structured group activity**: "Safety Scenario Sorting". Groups receive cards with safe and unsafe behaviors and must sort them. Discuss results as a class.

D. Independent Practice (10 min)
- **Individual task**: Students sign the safety contract and write a "Safety Pledge" in their journals, selecting one rule they think is most important and explaining why.

VI. Assessment & Wrap Up
- **Exit ticket**: "List 3 safety rules you must follow in the lab."
- **Homework**: Review safety contract with parents/guardians.
- **Formative checks**: Monitor sorting activity and journal entries.

VII. Differentiation & Supports
- **SPED / IDEA accommodations**: Step-by-step task cards, simplified text on safety rules.
- **ELL strategies**: Visual symbols for safety rules (e.g., goggles icon), word bank for journal writing.
- **Advanced learner extensions**: Create a safety poster for a specific complex chemical or tool.
