# Lesson 1: The Particle Model (Zooming In)

## I. Lesson Overview
*   **Topic:** Structure of Matter (5-PS1-1)
*   **Context:** This 2-day lesson block introduces the fundamental concept that all matter is made of particles too small to be seen. It bridges the gap between the macroscopic world (what we see) and the microscopic world (what is happening).
*   **Pacing:** Week 1-2 (September)
*   **Duration:** 90 Minutes (2 Class Periods)

## II. Learning Objectives
*   Students will develop a model to describe that matter is made of particles.
*   Students will explain that air has mass and takes up space, proving it is matter.
*   Students will visualize the arrangement of particles in solids, liquids, and gases.

## III. Standards Alignment
*   **5-PS1-1:** Develop a model to describe that matter is made of particles too small to be seen.
*   **SEP:** Developing and Using Models.
*   **CCC:** Scale, Proportion, and Quantity.

## IV. Materials Needed
*   **Physical:** Balloons, digital scale (sensitive to 0.1g), syringes (without needles), marbles/beads, clear plastic containers.
*   **Digital:** PhET Simulation "States of Matter: Basics".
*   **Printable:** "Zooming In" Particle Diagram Template.

## V. Lesson Procedure

### Part 1: Does Air Matter? (Day 1)
#### A. Introduction (Hook) - 15 Minutes
*   **The Weight of Air:** Place a deflated balloon on a scale. Record weight. Inflate it (add air) and tie it. Place it back on the scale.
*   **Ask:** "Did the weight go up?" (Yes, by a tiny amount). "Why? What did we add?"
*   **Concept:** Air is stuff. It has mass. It takes up space. Therefore, it is MATTER.

#### B. Direct Instruction - 15 Minutes
*   **Definition of Matter:** Anything that has mass and takes up space.
*   **The Problem:** We can feel wind, but we can't see the air parts. Why?
*   **Analogy:** A sand dune looks smooth from far away, but up close it is made of millions of tiny grains. Matter is the same.

#### C. Guided Practice - 15 Minutes
*   **Syringe Squish:** Students take a syringe, pull the plunger back to fill with air, put their finger over the tip, and try to push the plunger down.
*   **Observation:** You can squish it a little, but it bounces back. The air particles are trapped!

### Part 2: Modeling the Invisible (Day 2)
#### A. Simulation Exploration - 20 Minutes
*   **PhET Simulation:** Project the "States of Matter" sim.
*   **Solid:** Particles vibrate in place (like students sitting at desks).
*   **Liquid:** Particles slide past each other (like students mingling at recess).
*   **Gas:** Particles fly around and bounce (like dodgeball).

#### B. Independent Practice (The Model) - 20 Minutes
*   **Particle Art:** Students use the "Zooming In" template (a drawing of a water glass with a "magnifying glass" circle).
*   **Task:** Glue beads/draw circles to show what the water looks like zoomed in 1 billion times.
*   **Check for Understanding:** Particles should be close together but disordered (liquid), not a rigid grid (solid) or far apart (gas).

## VI. Assessment & Wrap-up
*   **Exit Ticket:** "If I could zoom in on the air inside the balloon, draw what I would see." (Students should draw scattered dots with space between them).
*   **Misconception Check:** Ensure students don't draw "air" filling the space between the particles. There is *nothing* (void) between particles.
