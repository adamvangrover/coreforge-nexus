I. Lesson Overview
- **Subject**: Science
- **Grade Level**: 5
- **Topic**: Capstone STEM Project
- **Duration**: 45 Minutes (Introductory Session)

II. Learning Objectives
1. Define a real-world problem to solve using science and engineering concepts.
2. Collaborate to plan a solution meeting specific criteria and constraints.
3. Present a design proposal.

III. Standards Alignment
- **NYSSLS Standard Codes**: 5-ETS1-1, 5-ETS1-2
- **Skill Focus**: Planning and carrying out investigations, designing solutions.

IV. Materials Needed
- "Problem Bank" (e.g., Oil spill cleanup, Earthquake-proof house, Seed dispersal device)
- Planning journals
- Chart paper for presentations

V. Lesson Procedure

A. Introduction (5–10 min)
- **Hook**: "You are now the engineers. We have some problems that need solving."
- **Prior knowledge activation**: Review Unit 6 Engineering Process.

B. Direct Instruction (15–20 min)
- **Explanation**: Explain the Capstone Project. Teams pick a problem, follow the cycle, and present a final prototype. Today is "Ask and Imagine".
- **Models/examples**: Review a sample project (e.g., "The Egg Drop").
- **Academic vocabulary**: Proposal, Collaboration, Iteration, Solution.

C. Guided Practice (10 min)
- **Structured group activity**: "Team Brainstorm". Teams select a problem from the bank. They brainstorm 3 possible solutions and sketch them quickly.

D. Independent Practice (10 min)
- **Individual task**: "Role Assignment". Each student writes down their role for the project (Materials Manager, Chief Architect, Tester, Recorder) and one goal for their team.

VI. Assessment & Wrap Up
- **Exit ticket**: "Which problem did your team pick and why?"
- **Formative checks**: Review initial sketches.

VII. Differentiation & Supports
- **SPED / IDEA accommodations**: Assigned roles based on strengths.
- **ELL strategies**: Graphic organizers for brainstorming.
- **Advanced learner extensions**: Create their own unique problem to solve (must be approved).
