I. Lesson Overview
- **Subject**: Science
- **Grade Level**: 5
- **Topic**: Designing Fair Experiments
- **Duration**: 45 Minutes

II. Learning Objectives
1. Define independent, dependent, and controlled variables.
2. Plan a controlled experiment to answer a testable question.
3. Critique experimental designs for fairness.

III. Standards Alignment
- **NYSSLS Standard Codes**: 5-ETS1-1, 5-ETS1-3
- **Skill Focus**: Planning and carrying out investigations.

IV. Materials Needed
- "Variable Sort" cards
- Experiment planning templates
- Chart paper
- Markers
- Example experiment descriptions (good and bad)

V. Lesson Procedure

A. Introduction (5–10 min)
- **Hook**: Ask "If we want to see which fertilizer helps plants grow best, can we also give one plant more water?" Discuss why or why not.
- **Prior knowledge activation**: Review the concept of a "test" from previous grades.

B. Direct Instruction (15–20 min)
- **Explanation**: Define "Fair Test". Introduce the three types of variables.
- **Models/examples**: Use the "Plant Growth" example to identify the Independent (Fertilizer), Dependent (Height), and Controlled (Water, Light, Pot size) variables.
- **Academic vocabulary**: Independent Variable, Dependent Variable, Controlled Variable (Constant), Fair Test.

C. Guided Practice (10 min)
- **Structured group activity**: "Create a System". Groups choose a simple question (e.g., "Does the height of a ramp affect how far a car rolls?") and identify the variables using a template.

D. Independent Practice (10 min)
- **Individual task**: Students write a short investigation plan for a question of their choice, explicitly listing the variables.

VI. Assessment & Wrap Up
- **Exit ticket**: "What is the one thing you change in an experiment called?"
- **Formative checks**: Review group templates during guided practice.

VII. Differentiation & Supports
- **SPED / IDEA accommodations**: Color-coded variable templates (Green=Go/Change, Red=Stop/Keep Same).
- **ELL strategies**: Sentence frames: "I will change the _____ to measure the _____."
- **Advanced learner extensions**: Identify potential sources of error in a given experiment.
