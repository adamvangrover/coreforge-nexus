# Lesson 2: Lab Safety & Investigation Prep

## I. Lesson Overview
*   **Topic:** Scientific Inquiry and Safety Protocols
*   **Context:** Before beginning the "Required Investigations," students must master the safety protocols mandated by NYS ed law. This lesson establishes the "Social Contract" for the lab.
*   **Pacing:** Week 3 (September)
*   **Duration:** 45 Minutes

## II. Learning Objectives
*   Students will identify and demonstrate proper use of safety equipment (goggles, gloves).
*   Students will practice the "Wafting" technique for smelling substances.
*   Students will understand the consequences of unsafe behavior (removal from lab).

## III. Standards Alignment
*   **NYS Lab Requirements:** Mandated safety instruction.
*   **SEP:** Planning and Carrying Out Investigations (Safety is a key component).

## IV. Materials Needed
*   **Safety Gear:** Goggles (class set), non-latex gloves, aprons.
*   **Demo Materials:** Water, vinegar, vanilla extract (for wafting practice).
*   **Printable:** "Lab Safety License" Card.

## V. Lesson Procedure

### A. Introduction (Hook) - 10 Minutes
*   **The "Unsafe Scientist":** Teacher puts on a skit (or shows a picture) of a scientist with untied long hair, drinking from a beaker, and no goggles.
*   **Hunt:** Students have 1 minute to spot all the dangers.

### B. Direct Instruction (The Rules) - 15 Minutes
*   **Rule 1: Goggles On.** Eyes are precious. We wear goggles whenever we use chemicals, heat, or glass.
*   **Rule 2: Waft, Don't Sniff.** Demonstrate the wafting hand motion. Never put your nose directly over a container.
*   **Rule 3: No Tasting.** Unless the teacher explicitly says "This is a taste test," nothing goes in the mouth.
*   **Rule 4: Spills.** Tell the teacher immediately. Don't hide it.

### C. Guided Practice (Wafting Drill) - 10 Minutes
*   **Station Rotation:** Set up 3 cups covered in foil with small holes.
    *   Cup A: Vinegar
    *   Cup B: Vanilla
    *   Cup C: Water
*   **Action:** Students practice wafting to identify the scent without looking.

### D. Assessment (The Contract) - 10 Minutes
*   **Safety Quiz:** 5 scenarios (e.g., "Julian breaks a beaker. What should he do?").
*   **Signing Ceremony:** Students sign their "Lab Safety License." They must have this signed to participate in "What's in the Bag?" next week.

## VI. Assessment & Wrap-up
*   **Pass/Fail:** Students must get 100% on the safety quiz to proceed. Retake immediately if missed.

## VII. Resources & References
*   Flinn Scientific Elementary Safety Contract.
