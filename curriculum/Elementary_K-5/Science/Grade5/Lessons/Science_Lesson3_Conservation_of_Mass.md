# Lesson 3: Conservation of Mass

## I. Lesson Overview
*   **Topic:** Conservation of Matter (5-PS1-2)
*   **Context:** Before the chemical reaction lab, students must understand that matter doesn't disappear. This lesson uses physical mixtures to prove that weight is additive.
*   **Pacing:** Week 4 (October)
*   **Duration:** 60 Minutes

## II. Learning Objectives
*   Students will measure and graph quantities to prove that the total weight of matter is conserved when mixed or dissolved.
*   Students will apply the additive property of mass ($Mass_{total} = Mass_{part1} + Mass_{part2}$).

## III. Standards Alignment
*   **5-PS1-2:** Measure and graph quantities to provide evidence that regardless of the type of change... the total weight of matter is conserved.
*   **SEP:** Using Mathematics and Computational Thinking.
*   **CCC:** Energy and Matter (Conservation).
*   **Math Connection:** 5.MD.1 (Measurement), 5.G.2 (Graphing).

## IV. Materials Needed
*   **Materials:** Digital scales, water, salt, cups, trail mix ingredients (raisins, pretzels).
*   **Worksheet:** "Mass Conservation Data Table."

## V. Lesson Procedure

### A. Introduction (Hook) - 10 Minutes
*   **The Disappearing Act:** Show a glass of water on a scale. Add a spoonful of salt. Stir until dissolved.
*   **Question:** "The salt is gone! I can't see it. Did the weight go back down?"
*   **Prediction:** Vote - Yes (weight dropped) or No (weight stayed up).

### B. Direct Instruction - 10 Minutes
*   **The Law:** Matter cannot be created or destroyed. It just changes form.
*   **The Math:** If I have 100g of water and 10g of salt, the solution MUST weigh 110g. If it weighs less, we spilled something!

### C. Guided Practice (The Trail Mix) - 20 Minutes
*   **Step 1:** Weigh Cup A (Pretzels). Record.
*   **Step 2:** Weigh Cup B (Raisins). Record.
*   **Step 3:** Predict Total Weight (A + B).
*   **Step 4:** Mix them in Cup C. Weigh Cup C.
*   **Analysis:** Does Actual = Predicted? (Within error margins).

### D. Independent Practice (The Dissolving Test) - 20 Minutes
*   **Challenge:** Prove the "Disappearing Act" hook.
*   **Action:** Students dissolve sugar in water, weighing before and after.
*   **Graphing:** Create a bar chart: "Water Mass," "Sugar Mass," "Predicted Total," "Actual Total."

## VI. Assessment & Wrap-up
*   **Exit Ticket:** "A popsicle weighs 50 grams. It melts into a puddle of juice. How much does the puddle weigh? Why?"
*   **Answer:** 50 grams. Melting (physical change) preserves mass.

## VII. Resources & References
*   NYSSLS Grade 5 Standards.
