I. Lesson Overview
- **Subject**: Science
- **Grade Level**: 5
- **Topic**: Using Models in Science
- **Duration**: 45 Minutes

II. Learning Objectives
1. Explain how models represent real-world systems.
2. Interpret a scientific model to understand a concept.
3. Identify the limitations of a given model.

III. Standards Alignment
- **NYSSLS Standard Codes**: 5-PS1-1 (Foundation for particle model)
- **Skill Focus**: Developing and using models.

IV. Materials Needed
- Various models (globe, plastic skeleton, solar system diagram, toy car)
- "Model Analysis" worksheet
- Building blocks or clay

V. Lesson Procedure

A. Introduction (5–10 min)
- **Hook**: Show a toy car and a picture of a real car. Ask "How are these the same? How are they different?"
- **Prior knowledge activation**: Discuss when students have used models before (maps, drawings).

B. Direct Instruction (15–20 min)
- **Explanation**: Discuss the purpose of models: to represent things that are too big, too small, too fast, or too slow to study directly.
- **Models/examples**: Analyze a globe as a model of Earth. Discuss what it shows (continents, oceans) and what it misses (clouds, moving traffic).
- **Academic vocabulary**: Model, Representation, Scale, System, Limitation.

C. Guided Practice (10 min)
- **Structured group activity**: "Diagram Building". Groups create a simple diagram model of the classroom arrangement on paper. Discuss what they chose to include and exclude.

D. Independent Practice (10 min)
- **Individual task**: Complete the "Model Explanation Worksheet". Students pick an object in the room and draw a model of it, labeling its key features.

VI. Assessment & Wrap Up
- **Exit ticket**: "Why do scientists use models?"
- **Formative checks**: Critiquing the classroom diagrams.

VII. Differentiation & Supports
- **SPED / IDEA accommodations**: Provide outlines or templates for drawing models.
- **ELL strategies**: Use physical objects (realia) alongside pictures.
- **Advanced learner extensions**: Discuss how computer simulations are also models.
