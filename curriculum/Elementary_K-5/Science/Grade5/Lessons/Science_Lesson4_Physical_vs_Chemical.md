# Lesson 4: Physical vs. Chemical Changes

## I. Lesson Overview
*   **Topic:** Distinguishing Types of Changes (5-PS1-4 Support)
*   **Context:** Following the "What's in the Bag?" investigation (Lesson 5), students consolidate their understanding by categorizing various changes.
*   **Pacing:** Week 7-8 (October/November)
*   **Duration:** 60 Minutes

## II. Learning Objectives
*   Students will classify changes as physical (reversible, same substance) or chemical (irreversible, new substance).
*   Students will identify evidence of chemical changes: Color Change, Gas Production, Temperature Change, Precipitate.

## III. Standards Alignment
*   **5-PS1-4:** Conduct an investigation to determine whether the mixing of two or more substances results in new substances.
*   **SEP:** Analyzing and Interpreting Data.
*   **CCC:** Cause and Effect.

## IV. Materials Needed
*   **Demo:** Paper (to rip and burn), Clay (to mold), Baking Soda/Vinegar (to react), Glow sticks.
*   **Cards:** Sort card deck with pictures of melting ice, burning wood, rusting iron, cutting hair, frying egg.

## V. Lesson Procedure

### A. Introduction (Hook) - 10 Minutes
*   **Rip vs. Burn:** Teacher rips a piece of paper. "Is it still paper?" (Yes).
*   **Action:** Teacher burns a small piece of paper (safely). "Is it still paper?" (No, it's ash/smoke).
*   **Definition:** Ripping = Physical. Burning = Chemical.

### B. Direct Instruction - 15 Minutes
*   **The Signs:** How do we know it's Chemical? (Use the acronym **G.O.T. C.P.**)
    *   **G**as (Bubbles)
    *   **O**dor (Smell change)
    *   **T**emperature (Hotter/Colder without stove/fridge)
    *   **C**olor (Unexpected change)
    *   **P**recipitate (Two liquids make a solid chunk)

### C. Guided Practice (The Sort) - 20 Minutes
*   **Group Work:** Students sort 20 scenario cards into "Physical" or "Chemical" columns.
    *   *Tricky one:* Boiling water. (Physical - it's still H2O, just gas).
    *   *Tricky one:* Dissolving salt. (Physical - you can evaporate the water and get the salt back).

### D. Independent Practice - 15 Minutes
*   **The "Glow Stick" Analysis:** Crack a glow stick.
*   **Question:** Is this physical or chemical?
*   **Evidence:** Light is produced (Energy release). It is chemical!
*   **Writing:** Write a CER explaining why a rotting apple is a chemical change.

## VI. Assessment & Wrap-up
*   **Exit Ticket:** "Melting Butter vs. Burning Toast. Label each and explain the difference."

## VII. Resources & References
*   Inquiry in Action: American Chemical Society.
