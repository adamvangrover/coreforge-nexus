I. Lesson Overview
- **Subject**: Science
- **Grade Level**: 5
- **Topic**: States of Matter & Particle Theory
- **Duration**: 45 Minutes

II. Learning Objectives
1. Describe the properties of solids, liquids, and gases.
2. Explain matter as made of particles too small to be seen.
3. Model particle movement in different states.

III. Standards Alignment
- **NYSSLS Standard Codes**: 5-PS1-1
- **Skill Focus**: Developing and using models.

IV. Materials Needed
- Water, Ice, Balloon (filled with air)
- Beads or marbles (to represent particles)
- Clear containers
- Science journals

V. Lesson Procedure

A. Introduction (5–10 min)
- **Hook**: Show a block of ice, a cup of water, and the balloon. Ask "What makes these different?"
- **Prior knowledge activation**: Review solid, liquid, gas concepts.

B. Direct Instruction (15–20 min)
- **Explanation**: Introduce the concept that all matter is made of tiny particles.
- **Models/examples**: Use the "Kinetic Theory" model. Solids: particles vibrate in place. Liquids: particles slide past each other. Gases: particles bounce freely.
- **Academic vocabulary**: Matter, Particle, Solid, Liquid, Gas, Vibration.

C. Guided Practice (10 min)
- **Structured group activity**: "Particle Simulation". Students act as particles. Teacher calls out a state, and students move accordingly (huddle tight for solid, walk/flow for liquid, run/spread out for gas).

D. Independent Practice (10 min)
- **Individual task**: "State Change Diagram". Students draw the arrangement of particles for a solid, liquid, and gas in their journals.

VI. Assessment & Wrap Up
- **Exit ticket**: "Draw what water particles look like compared to ice particles."
- **Formative checks**: Observation of the student simulation activity.

VII. Differentiation & Supports
- **SPED / IDEA accommodations**: Use physical manipulatives (beads in a box) instead of drawing if fine motor skills are a challenge.
- **ELL strategies**: Image cards matching states to particle diagrams.
- **Advanced learner extensions**: Investigate "plasma" as a fourth state.
