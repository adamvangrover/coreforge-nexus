I. Lesson Overview
- **Subject**: Science
- **Grade Level**: 5
- **Topic**: Physical vs Chemical Changes
- **Duration**: 45 Minutes

II. Learning Objectives
1. Differentiate between physical and chemical changes.
2. Identify evidence of chemical reactions (gas, color change, heat).
3. Classify observed changes correctly.

III. Standards Alignment
- **NYSSLS Standard Codes**: 5-PS1-4
- **Skill Focus**: Analyzing and interpreting data.

IV. Materials Needed
- Paper (for tearing/crumpling)
- Baking soda and vinegar
- Clear cups
- Modeling clay
- Safety goggles

V. Lesson Procedure

A. Introduction (5–10 min)
- **Hook**: Tear a piece of paper. Ask "Is it still paper?" Then show a video of paper burning. Ask "Is it still paper?"
- **Prior knowledge activation**: Discuss changes students see in cooking.

B. Direct Instruction (15–20 min)
- **Explanation**: Define Physical Change (structure stays the same, e.g., melting ice) vs. Chemical Change (new substance formed).
- **Models/examples**: Demonstrate Baking Soda + Vinegar (Gas production = Chemical). Demonstrate molding clay (Shape change = Physical).
- **Academic vocabulary**: Physical Change, Chemical Reaction, Reactant, Product, Evidence.

C. Guided Practice (10 min)
- **Structured group activity**: "Reaction Station". Perform simple tests: mixing salt and water (Physical), mixing milk and vinegar (Chemical - curdling). Record observations.

D. Independent Practice (10 min)
- **Individual task**: "Change Classification". Worksheet with scenarios (rusting bike, melting butter, cutting wood, frying egg). Students label P or C and state evidence.

VI. Assessment & Wrap Up
- **Exit ticket**: "List 3 clues that a chemical change has happened."
- **Formative checks**: Review worksheet answers.

VII. Differentiation & Supports
- **SPED / IDEA accommodations**: Checklist of "Evidence of Chemical Change" to use during the lesson.
- **ELL strategies**: Photo cues for each scenario on the worksheet.
- **Advanced learner extensions**: Explore reversible vs. irreversible physical changes.
