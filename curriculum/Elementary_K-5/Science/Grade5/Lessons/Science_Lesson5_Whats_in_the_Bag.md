# Lesson 5: What's in the Bag? (Chemical Reactions)

## I. Lesson Overview
*   **Topic:** Chemical Reactions and New Substances (5-PS1-4)
*   **Context:** Students often confuse physical mixtures (like fruit salad) with chemical mixtures. This lesson serves as the mandated "What's in the Bag?" investigation where students create a new substance.
*   **Duration:** 60 Minutes

## II. Learning Objectives
*   Students will be able to distinguish between physical and chemical changes based on observable properties.
*   Students will conduct a "Fair Test" investigation to determine if a new substance is formed when mixing baking soda, calcium chloride, and phenol red.
*   Students will demonstrate safe laboratory practices (wafting, goggles).

## III. Standards Alignment
*   **5-PS1-4:** Conduct an investigation to determine whether the mixing of two or more substances results in new substances.
*   **SEP:** Planning and Carrying Out Investigations.
*   **CCC:** Cause and Effect.

## IV. Materials Needed
*   **Reactants:** Baking soda (Sodium Bicarbonate), Calcium Chloride (Road Salt), Phenol Red solution (or cabbage juice indicator).
*   **Equipment:** Ziplock sandwich bags, small cups (medicine cups), safety goggles (Required), spoons.
*   **Safety Note:** Calcium Chloride is exothermic (releases heat). Goggles are non-negotiable.

## V. Lesson Procedure

### A. Introduction (Hook) - 10 Minutes
*   **The Exploding Lunch Bag:** The teacher demonstrates mixing baking soda and vinegar in a sealed bag. The bag inflates rapidly and pops (or gets very tight).
*   **Prompt:** "We mixed a solid and a liquid, and suddenly the bag blew up with gas. Where did the gas come from? Was it hiding in the powder?"
*   **Concept:** Introduce the idea that a *new substance* (gas) was created.

### B. Direct Instruction - 10 Minutes
*   **Physical vs. Chemical:** Explain that in a physical change (melting ice), the substance is still the same (water). In a chemical change, the properties change (color, temp, gas).
*   **Safety Briefing:** Demonstrate how to use goggles, how to "waft" if smelling is necessary (though not for this lab), and how to handle Calcium Chloride carefully.

### C. Guided Practice (The Investigation) - 30 Minutes
*   **Step 1:** Students place 1 spoon of baking soda in one corner of the bag.
*   **Step 2:** Students place 1 spoon of calcium chloride in the other corner.
*   **Step 3:** Students place a small cup of phenol red upright inside the bag *without spilling*.
*   **Step 4:** Seal the bag tightly (remove air).
*   **Step 5:** Tip the cup and mix everything.
*   **Observation:** The mixture will turn bright yellow/orange, get hot (exothermic), and fill with gas (carbon dioxide).
*   **Data Collection:** Students record observations: "It got hot," "It turned yellow," "Gas filled the bag."

### D. Independent Practice / Analysis - 10 Minutes
*   **Prediction Sheet:** Students complete a diagram labeling the reactants and the products (Gas, Color Change, Heat).
*   **Claim-Evidence-Reasoning (CER):** Write a statement: "A chemical reaction occurred because [evidence]."

## VI. Assessment & Wrap-up
*   **Exit Ticket:** "If you mix a solid and a liquid and it bubbles, is that a physical change or a chemical change? What is your evidence?"
*   **Differentiation:**
    *   *Support:* Provide sentence stems ("I know it is a chemical change because...")
    *   *Extension:* Ask students to identify which reactant caused the heat vs. the gas (by mixing pairs).
