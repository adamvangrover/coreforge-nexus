I. Lesson Overview
- **Subject**: Science
- **Grade Level**: 5
- **Topic**: Conservation of Matter
- **Duration**: 45 Minutes

II. Learning Objectives
1. Explain that matter is not created or destroyed, only changed.
2. Demonstrate conservation of mass using a closed system.
3. Measure and compare weights before and after mixing.

III. Standards Alignment
- **NYSSLS Standard Codes**: 5-PS1-2
- **Skill Focus**: Using mathematics and computational thinking.

IV. Materials Needed
- Digital scales
- Ziplock bags
- Antacid tablets
- Water
- Cups

V. Lesson Procedure

A. Introduction (5–10 min)
- **Hook**: Ask "If I melt an ice cube, does it weigh less than the water it turns into?"
- **Prior knowledge activation**: Review measuring weight/mass.

B. Direct Instruction (15–20 min)
- **Explanation**: Introduce the Law of Conservation of Matter. "Stuff doesn't disappear, it just moves or changes form."
- **Models/examples**: Show a balance scale concept.
- **Academic vocabulary**: Conservation, Mass, Weight, Closed System, Open System.

C. Guided Practice (10 min)
- **Structured group activity**: "Bag Reaction". Put water cup and antacid tablet inside a ziplock bag. Seal it. Weigh it. Drop the tablet into the water (inside the bag). Watch it fizz. Weigh it again. (Weight should be the same).

D. Independent Practice (10 min)
- **Individual task**: "Lab Reflection". Students write down their data: "Mass Before = ___g", "Mass After = ___g". Explain why the weight stayed the same even though gas was made.

VI. Assessment & Wrap Up
- **Exit ticket**: "If you burn a log, the ash weighs less. Did the matter disappear? Where did it go?" (Answer: Into the air as smoke/gas).
- **Formative checks**: Monitor the weighing process for accuracy.

VII. Differentiation & Supports
- **SPED / IDEA accommodations**: Digital scales are easier to read than triple-beam balances. Peer support for handling materials.
- **ELL strategies**: Illustrated steps for the "Bag Reaction" procedure.
- **Advanced learner extensions**: Discuss what would happen if the bag was open (Open System).
