# Lesson 6: Gravity: The Invisible Pull

## I. Lesson Overview
*   **Topic:** Gravitational Force (5-PS2-1)
*   **Context:** This lesson shifts focus from the micro (particles) to the macro (Earth). It addresses the misconception that gravity is "air pressure" or "magnetism."
*   **Pacing:** Week 14 (December)
*   **Duration:** 60 Minutes

## II. Learning Objectives
*   Students will support an argument that the gravitational force exerted by Earth on objects is directed down.
*   Students will define "down" as "towards the center of the Earth."

## III. Standards Alignment
*   **5-PS2-1:** Support an argument that the gravitational force exerted by Earth on objects is directed down.
*   **SEP:** Engaging in Argument from Evidence.
*   **CCC:** Cause and Effect.

## IV. Materials Needed
*   **Materials:** Globe, tiny figure/Lego person, ball, whiteboard.
*   **Video:** Footage of astronauts dropping objects on the Moon.

## V. Lesson Procedure

### A. Introduction (Hook) - 10 Minutes
*   **The Drop:** Hold a ball. Ask: "If I let go, where will it go?" (Down).
*   **The Upside Down Globe:** Tape a Lego person to the "bottom" (Antarctica) of a globe.
*   **Question:** "If this person drops a ball, which way does it fall?"
*   **Misconception:** Many students point "down" relative to the classroom floor (away from the globe).
*   **Correction:** It falls *towards the globe*.

### B. Direct Instruction - 15 Minutes
*   **Definition:** Gravity is a force that pulls objects with mass towards each other. Earth is huge, so it pulls us hard.
*   **Defining "Down":** Down is always towards the center of the planet.
*   **The Center:** If we dug a hole through Earth and jumped in, we would fall to the center and stop (eventually). We wouldn't fall out the other side.

### C. Guided Practice (Argument Writing) - 20 Minutes
*   **Scenario:** "Flat Earther Argument." A character says, "People in Australia would fall off if the Earth was round."
*   **Task:** Write a rebuttal using the word "Gravity" and "Center."
*   **Sentence Frame:** "The character is wrong because gravity pulls everything towards ________. People in Australia are pulled ________, just like us."

### D. Independent Practice - 15 Minutes
*   **Diagramming:** Draw Earth with people at North Pole, South Pole, and Equator. Draw arrows showing the direction a dropped apple would fall for each person. (All arrows must point to the core).

## VI. Assessment & Wrap-up
*   **Exit Ticket:** "Does gravity need air to work? Hint: Think about the Moon video." (Answer: No, gravity works in a vacuum).

## VII. Resources & References
*   NASA "Gravity" Educational Resources.
