I. Lesson Overview
- **Subject**: Science
- **Grade Level**: 5
- **Topic**: Mixtures and Solutions
- **Duration**: 45 Minutes

II. Learning Objectives
1. Distinguish between mixtures and solutions.
2. Explain the concepts of dissolving and solubility.
3. Investigate the solubility of different substances in water.

III. Standards Alignment
- **NYSSLS Standard Codes**: 5-PS1-3
- **Skill Focus**: Planning and carrying out investigations.

IV. Materials Needed
- Transparent cups
- Water
- Sand, Salt, Sugar, Oil, Gravel
- Stirring rods
- "Solubility Lab Chart"

V. Lesson Procedure

A. Introduction (5–10 min)
- **Hook**: Show a jar of trail mix and a glass of lemonade. Ask "How are these combinations different?"
- **Prior knowledge activation**: Review solids and liquids.

B. Direct Instruction (15–20 min)
- **Explanation**: Define Mixture (substances combined but keep their properties, easy to separate) vs. Solution (one substance dissolves in another, hard to separate physically).
- **Models/examples**: Sand in water (Mixture). Salt in water (Solution).
- **Academic vocabulary**: Mixture, Solution, Solute, Solvent, Dissolve, Solubility.

C. Guided Practice (10 min)
- **Structured group activity**: "Mixing Station". Groups test 3 substances (Sand, Salt, Oil) in water. They stir and observe: Does it vanish? Does it float? Does it settle?

D. Independent Practice (10 min)
- **Individual task**: Complete the "Solubility Lab Chart". Record observations for each substance and classify it as forming a mixture or a solution.

VI. Assessment & Wrap Up
- **Exit ticket**: "Is ocean water a mixture or a solution? Why?"
- **Formative checks**: Review lab charts during the activity.

VII. Differentiation & Supports
- **SPED / IDEA accommodations**: Pre-labeled cups and measured substances.
- **ELL strategies**: Visual lab guide with pictures of "Dissolved" vs. "Undissolved".
- **Advanced learner extensions**: Experiment with warm vs. cold water to see how temperature affects solubility.
