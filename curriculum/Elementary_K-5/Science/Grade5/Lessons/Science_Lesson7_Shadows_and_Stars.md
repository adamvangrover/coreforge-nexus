# Lesson 7: Shadows, Day/Night, and Stars

## I. Lesson Overview
*   **Topic:** Patterns in the Sky (5-ESS1-1, 5-ESS1-2)
*   **Context:** A 2-day lesson exploring how Earth's rotation and orbit cause observable patterns. This sets the stage for understanding our place in the universe.
*   **Pacing:** Week 15-16 (December/January)
*   **Duration:** 90 Minutes (2 Days)

## II. Learning Objectives
*   Students will represent data to reveal patterns of daily changes in shadow length and direction.
*   Students will explain why the Sun appears brighter than other stars (Distance).
*   Students will demonstrate that Earth's rotation causes Day/Night.

## III. Standards Alignment
*   **5-ESS1-1:** Support an argument that differences in the apparent brightness of the sun compared to other stars is due to their relative distances from the Earth.
*   **5-ESS1-2:** Represent data in graphical displays to reveal patterns...
*   **SEP:** Analyzing and Interpreting Data.
*   **CCC:** Patterns.

## IV. Materials Needed
*   **Materials:** Flashlights (Sun), globes, "Shadow Stick" (pencil in clay), chalk (for outdoor tracking).
*   **Data:** Sample data of shadow lengths at 9am, 12pm, 3pm.

## V. Lesson Procedure

### Part 1: Shadows and Rotation (Day 1)
#### A. Introduction (Hook) - 15 Minutes
*   **Outdoor Lab (Weather Permitting):** Go outside at 9:00 AM. Partner A stands still. Partner B traces their shadow with chalk.
*   **Prediction:** "Where will the shadow be at lunchtime?"

#### B. Direct Instruction - 15 Minutes
*   **Rotation:** Earth spins (rotates) once every 24 hours. The Sun stays still.
*   **Shadow Rules:**
    *   Low Sun (Morning/Evening) = Long Shadow.
    *   High Sun (Noon) = Short Shadow.
    *   Direction is *opposite* the light.

#### C. Data Analysis - 15 Minutes
*   **Graphing:** Students graph provided data (Time vs. Shadow Length).
*   **Pattern:** The line goes down (towards noon) and back up (towards evening). A "U" shape.

### Part 2: Stars and Distance (Day 2)
#### A. The Brightness Test - 20 Minutes
*   **Demo:** Take two identical flashlights.
*   **Setup:** Place one 1 meter away. Place the other 10 meters away.
*   **Observation:** The close one looks huge and bright. The far one looks like a tiny dot.
*   **Analogy:** The Sun is the close flashlight. Other stars are the far flashlights. They are huge (some bigger than the Sun!), but far away.

#### B. Independent Practice - 20 Minutes
*   **CER Writing:** "Why do stars look like tiny dots if they are giant balls of fire?"
*   **Claim:** Stars look small because they are far away.
*   **Evidence:** In our flashlight experiment...

## VI. Assessment & Wrap-up
*   **Exit Ticket:** "If I stand outside at 12:00 PM (Noon), will my shadow be Long or Short? Why?"

## VII. Resources & References
*   Stellarium Web (Online Planetarium).
