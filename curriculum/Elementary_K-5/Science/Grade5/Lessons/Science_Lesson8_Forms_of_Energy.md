I. Lesson Overview
- **Subject**: Science
- **Grade Level**: 5
- **Topic**: Forms of Energy
- **Duration**: 45 Minutes

II. Learning Objectives
1. Identify common forms of energy: thermal, electrical, light, sound, and mechanical.
2. Explain that energy causes change or motion.
3. Categorize everyday objects by the energy they use or produce.

III. Standards Alignment
- **NYSSLS Standard Codes**: 5-PS3-1
- **Skill Focus**: Obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information.

IV. Materials Needed
- Flashlight (Light)
- Hand warmer (Thermal)
- Bell (Sound)
- Toy car (Mechanical)
- "Energy Scavenger Hunt" worksheet

V. Lesson Procedure

A. Introduction (5–10 min)
- **Hook**: Turn off the lights. Ask "What changed?" Turn them on. "What form of energy is this?"
- **Prior knowledge activation**: Ask students what makes their toys work (batteries, pushing).

B. Direct Instruction (15–20 min)
- **Explanation**: Define Energy as "the ability to do work or cause change". Discuss Potential vs. Kinetic (briefly) and specific forms.
- **Models/examples**: Sun (Light/Heat), Toaster (Electrical -> Thermal), Guitar (Mechanical -> Sound).
- **Academic vocabulary**: Energy, Thermal, Electrical, Mechanical, Sound, Light.

C. Guided Practice (10 min)
- **Structured group activity**: "Energy Station Rotation". Students visit stations with different objects and identify the main form of energy.

D. Independent Practice (10 min)
- **Individual task**: "Energy Scavenger Hunt". Students look around the classroom to find examples of light, sound, heat, and motion energy.

VI. Assessment & Wrap Up
- **Exit ticket**: "Name two forms of energy a campfire produces." (Light and Thermal).
- **Formative checks**: Discuss scavenger hunt findings.

VII. Differentiation & Supports
- **SPED / IDEA accommodations**: Picture bank of energy sources to circle on the worksheet.
- **ELL strategies**: Flashcards with images and labels for each energy type.
- **Advanced learner extensions**: Discuss energy transformations (e.g., how a battery turns chemical energy into electrical).
