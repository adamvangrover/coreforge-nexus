# Lesson 8: Light It Up (Energy & Circuits)

## I. Lesson Overview
*   **Topic:** Energy Transfer and Engineering Design (4-PS3-2 / 5-ETS1)
*   **Context:** While Energy standards bridge grades 4-5, this lesson serves as the key engineering experience for Grade 5, focusing on designing systems to transfer energy.
*   **Duration:** 60 Minutes

## II. Learning Objectives
*   Students will design and construct a simple electric circuit to light a bulb.
*   Students will distinguish between open and closed circuits.
*   Students will test materials to classify them as conductors or insulators.

## III. Standards Alignment
*   **4-PS3-2:** Make observations to provide evidence that energy can be transferred from place to place by sound, light, heat, and electric currents.
*   **3-5-ETS1-1:** Define a simple design problem reflecting a need or a want.
*   **SEP:** Constructing Explanations and Designing Solutions.

## IV. Materials Needed
*   **Components:** D-cell batteries, battery holders, small bulbs, bulb holders, alligator clip wires.
*   **Test Items:** Aluminum foil, paper clips, rubber bands, wood sticks, plastic spoons.

## V. Lesson Procedure

### A. Introduction (Hook) - 10 Minutes
*   **Challenge:** Hand a student a battery, a wire, and a bulb. Ask them to make it light up *without* tape or holders.
*   **Discussion:** It's harder than it looks! You need a complete "circle" or circuit for the energy to flow.

### B. Direct Instruction - 10 Minutes
*   **Circuit Anatomy:** Draw a schematic.
    *   **Source:** Battery (Pushing the electrons).
    *   **Path:** Wire (Conductor).
    *   **Load:** Bulb (Converts electrical energy to light/heat).
*   **Open vs. Closed:** An open gap stops the flow. A closed loop allows flow.

### C. Guided Practice (The Investigation) - 30 Minutes
*   **Part 1 - Build It:** Students work in pairs to build a functional circuit using holders and clips.
*   **Part 2 - Break It:** Intentionally create a gap.
*   **Part 3 - Test It (Conductors vs. Insulators):** Place various objects in the gap.
    *   Does foil work? (Yes - Conductor)
    *   Does rubber work? (No - Insulator)
*   **Engineering Challenge:** "Design a switch." Use the materials (paperclip + brads) to create a mechanism that opens and closes the circuit easily.

### D. Independent Practice - 10 Minutes
*   **Schematic Drawing:** Students draw their circuit using standard symbols (line for wire, circle with X for bulb, parallel lines for battery).
*   **Reflection:** "Why are wires covered in plastic? Use the words 'conductor' and 'insulator' in your answer."

## VI. Assessment & Wrap-up
*   **Performance Task:** Successfully demonstrate a working circuit with a switch to the teacher.
*   **Exit Ticket:** Drawing of a circuit labeled with "Source," "Path," and "Load."

## VII. Resources & References
*   PhET "Circuit Construction Kit" Simulation.
*   NYSSLS Science & Engineering Practices.
