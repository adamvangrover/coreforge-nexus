# Lesson 9: Engineering Challenge: Design a Flashlight

## I. Lesson Overview
*   **Topic:** Engineering Design Process (3-5-ETS1)
*   **Context:** Following the "Light It Up" investigation (Lesson 8), students apply their knowledge of circuits to solve a problem.
*   **Pacing:** Week 13 (December)
*   **Duration:** 60 Minutes

## II. Learning Objectives
*   Students will define a simple design problem (portable light source).
*   Students will apply scientific ideas (circuitry) to design a solution.
*   Students will build and test a prototype.

## III. Standards Alignment
*   **3-5-ETS1-1:** Define a simple design problem reflecting a need or a want.
*   **3-5-ETS1-2:** Generate and compare multiple possible solutions.
*   **SEP:** Designing Solutions.

## IV. Materials Needed
*   **Building:** Cardboard tubes (TP rolls), plastic cups, tape, batteries, wires, bulbs, foil, paper clips (switches).
*   **Tools:** Scissors.

## V. Lesson Procedure

### A. Define the Problem (Ask) - 10 Minutes
*   **Scenario:** "The power went out! You need a light to read your book, but you can't carry a pile of wires and batteries in your hands loosely. You need a device."
*   **Criteria:** Must light up on command (switch). Must be portable (held in one hand).
*   **Constraints:** Use only materials provided.

### B. Brainstorm & Plan (Imagine) - 10 Minutes
*   **Sketching:** Students draw their design.
*   **Key Feature:** How will the switch work? (Push button? Slide?)

### C. Create & Test (Plan/Create) - 30 Minutes
*   **Build Phase:** Students assemble their flashlights.
*   **Troubleshooting:**
    *   "My light flickers!" (Loose connection -> Secure with tape).
    *   "It won't turn off!" (Switch isn't breaking the circuit).
*   **Teacher Role:** Guide, don't fix. Ask: "Where is the gap?"

### D. Improve - 10 Minutes
*   **Critique:** Swap flashlights with another group.
*   **Feedback:** "The switch is hard to reach." "It's too heavy."
*   **Revision:** What would you change next time?

## VI. Assessment & Wrap-up
*   **Rubric:**
    1.  Functionality (Does it light?)
    2.  Portability (Can you hold it?)
    3.  Switch (Can you control it?)
    4.  Teamwork.
