I. Lesson Overview
- **Subject**: Science
- **Grade Level**: 5
- **Topic**: Forces and Motion
- **Duration**: 45 Minutes

II. Learning Objectives
1. Define force as a push or a pull.
2. Explain how gravity acts as a force directed downward.
3. Investigate how friction affects the motion of an object.

III. Standards Alignment
- **NYSSLS Standard Codes**: 5-PS2-1
- **Skill Focus**: Engaging in argument from evidence.

IV. Materials Needed
- Ramps (books and boards)
- Toy cars
- Different surfaces (carpet, tile, sandpaper)
- "Force and Motion Diagram" sheet

V. Lesson Procedure

A. Introduction (5–10 min)
- **Hook**: Drop a ball. "Why did it go down and not up?"
- **Prior knowledge activation**: Review "push" and "pull".

B. Direct Instruction (15–20 min)
- **Explanation**: Define Force. Introduce Gravity (pulls things to Earth) and Friction (resists motion).
- **Models/examples**: Show how a car slows down on carpet vs. floor.
- **Academic vocabulary**: Force, Gravity, Friction, Motion, Push, Pull.

C. Guided Practice (10 min)
- **Structured group activity**: "Ramp Races". Groups roll cars down ramps onto different surfaces. Measure how far they go. Discuss why carpet makes the car stop sooner (Friction).

D. Independent Practice (10 min)
- **Individual task**: Complete the "Force and Motion Diagram". Draw a car on a ramp and use arrows to show Gravity (down) and Friction (against motion).

VI. Assessment & Wrap Up
- **Exit ticket**: "Which surface has more friction: ice or sandpaper?"
- **Formative checks**: Review diagrams for correct arrow direction.

VII. Differentiation & Supports
- **SPED / IDEA accommodations**: Pre-drawn diagrams where students only need to add arrows.
- **ELL strategies**: Physical demonstration of "rough" vs. "smooth" surfaces.
- **Advanced learner extensions**: Explore air resistance as a type of friction.
