# Grade 5 Science: Course Syllabus & Pacing Guide

## Course Overview
This comprehensive Grade 5 Science curriculum is designed to inspire curiosity and foster a deep understanding of the natural world through the lenses of Matter, Ecosystems, Earth Systems, and Space. Aligned with the New York State P-12 Science Learning Standards (NYSSLS) and Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), this course integrates hands-on experimentation, inquiry-based learning, and cross-cutting concepts.
