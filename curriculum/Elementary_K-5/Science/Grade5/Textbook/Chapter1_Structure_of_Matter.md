# Chapter 1: Structure and Properties of Matter

## 1.1 What is Matter?

Everything around you is made of **matter**. Matter is anything that has mass and takes up space (volume). The air you breathe, the water you drink, and the chair you sit on are all examples of matter.

### The Particle Nature of Matter
Scientists use a model to explain how matter behaves. This is called the **Particle Model of Matter**.
* **Small Particles**: All matter is made of tiny particles that are too small to be seen with the naked eye.
* **Empty Space**: There is empty space between these particles.
* **Constant Motion**: These particles are always moving.

## 1.2 States of Matter

Matter exists in three primary states on Earth: **Solid**, **Liquid**, and **Gas**.

### Solids
In a solid, particles are packed tightly together in a fixed arrangement. They vibrate but do not move past each other. This is why solids keep their shape and volume.
* *Example*: Ice, Wood, Metal.

### Liquids
In a liquid, particles are close together but not in a fixed arrangement. They can slide past each other. This allows liquids to flow and take the shape of their container, though they keep a constant volume.
* *Example*: Water, Oil, Mercury.

### Gases
In a gas, particles are far apart and move freely at high speeds. Gases expand to fill whatever container they are in, meaning they have neither a fixed shape nor a fixed volume.
* *Example*: Oxygen, Helium, Steam.

## 1.3 Properties of Matter

We can describe matter by its properties.

* **Color**: Visual appearance.
* **Hardness**: Resistance to scratching.
* **Reflectivity**: Ability to bounce light.
* **Electrical Conductivity**: Ability to let electricity flow through.
* **Thermal Conductivity**: Ability to let heat flow through.
* **Solubility**: The ability to dissolve in water. For example, salt and sugar are soluble, while sand is not.
* **Magnetism**: Response to a magnet.

## 1.4 Changes in Matter

### Physical Changes
A change where the substance stays the same, even if its appearance changes.
* *Examples*: Melting ice, tearing paper, dissolving sugar in water.

### Chemical Changes
A change where a new substance is formed.
* *Examples*: Burning wood (turns to ash and smoke), rusting iron, baking a cake.
* *Signs of a Chemical Change*: Color change, gas production (bubbles), temperature change, formation of a precipitate.

## Review Questions
1. Define matter.
2. Compare the movement of particles in a solid vs. a gas.
3. Is melting butter a physical or chemical change? Explain.
