I. Unit Overview
This unit establishes the foundational practices of scientific inquiry, focusing on asking questions, planning investigations, and using models. Students will learn lab safety, variable identification, and how to represent systems through modeling.

II. Big Ideas & Essential Questions
- **Big Idea**: Science relies on asking questions, conducting investigations, and using models to explain phenomena.
- **Essential Questions**:
  1. How do scientists investigate the world?
  2. Why are models important in science?

III. Standards Alignment
- **5-PS1-1**: Develop a model to describe that matter is made of particles too small to be seen. (Practiced through modeling skills)
- **5-ETS1-1**: Define a simple design problem reflecting a need or a want that includes specified criteria for success and constraints on materials, time, or cost.

IV. Lesson Sequence
- **Lesson 1**: Scientific Inquiry & Lab Safety
- **Lesson 2**: Designing Fair Experiments
- **Lesson 3**: Using Models in Science

V. Assessment Framework
- **Formative**: Observation rubric, exit tickets, science notebooks.
- **Summative**: Lab performance task (designing an experiment), Lab Safety Quiz.

VI. Differentiation & Accessibility
- **ELL**: Visual vocabulary cards, sentence starters for hypothesis writing.
- **SPED**: Step-by-step experiment guides, graphic organizers for variables.

VII. Cross-Curricular Connections
- **ELA**: Writing informational text (procedures).
- **Math**: Measuring and recording data.

VIII. Teacher Implementation Notes
- Ensure all safety agreements are signed before lab work begins.
- Emphasize that models are not just "pictures" but tools for explanation.
