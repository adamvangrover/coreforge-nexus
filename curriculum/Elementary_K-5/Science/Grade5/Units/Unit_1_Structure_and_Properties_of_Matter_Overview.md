# Unit 1: Structure and Properties of Matter

## I. Unit Overview
This unit serves as the foundational entry point for Grade 5 science. It addresses the abstract concept that matter is made of particles too small to be seen and explores the conservation of matter. Students will engage in "Fair Test" investigations to distinguish between physical and chemical changes.

## II. Standards Alignment
*   **5-PS1-1:** Develop a model to describe that matter is made of particles too small to be seen.
*   **5-PS1-2:** Measure and graph quantities to provide evidence that regardless of the type of change that occurs when heating, cooling, or mixing substances, the total weight of matter is conserved.
*   **5-PS1-3:** Make observations and measurements to identify materials based on their properties.
*   **5-PS1-4:** Conduct an investigation to determine whether the mixing of two or more substances results in new substances.

## III. Key Concepts & Essential Questions
*   **Concepts:** Particle Model, Conservation of Mass, Chemical vs. Physical Changes, Solubility.
*   **Essential Questions:**
    *   If we can't see the particles, how do we know they are there?
    *   Where does the matter go when it dissolves?
    *   How can we tell if a new substance is created?

## IV. Mandated Investigation: "What's in the Bag?"
*   **Objective:** Students mix baking soda, calcium chloride, and phenol red in a closed system to observe evidence of a chemical reaction (gas production, color change, temperature change) and confirm conservation of mass.
*   **Pacing:** Week 5-6 (October)

## V. Resources
*   **Materials:** Balances, beakers, baking soda, vinegar, calcium chloride, phenol red, ziplock bags.
*   **Digital:** PhET "States of Matter" simulation.
