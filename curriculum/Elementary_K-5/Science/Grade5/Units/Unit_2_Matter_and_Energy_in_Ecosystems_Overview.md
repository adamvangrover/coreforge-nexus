# Unit 2: Matter and Energy in Ecosystems

## I. Unit Overview
This unit integrates Life Science and Physical Science to explore how energy flows through ecosystems. It challenges the misconception that plants "eat" soil, focusing instead on photosynthesis and the cycling of matter.

## II. Standards Alignment
*   **5-LS1-1:** Support an argument that plants get the materials they need for growth chiefly from air and water.
*   **5-LS2-1:** Develop a model to describe the movement of matter among plants, animals, decomposers, and the environment.
*   **5-PS3-1:** Use models to describe that energy in animals’ food (used for body repair, growth, motion, and to maintain body warmth) was once energy from the sun.

## III. Key Concepts & Essential Questions
*   **Concepts:** Photosynthesis (Air/Water source), Food Webs, Decomposition, Energy Transfer.
*   **Essential Questions:**
    *   How does the sun's energy get into a hamburger?
    *   Do plants need soil to gain weight?
    *   How does nature recycle dead organisms?

## IV. Mandated Investigation: "Circle of Life"
*   **Objective:** A longitudinal study (4-6 weeks) observing the life cycle of an organism (e.g., Fast Plants, mealworms) and its interaction with the environment to understand traits and energy requirements.
*   **Pacing:** Week 23-30 (May-June)

## V. Resources
*   **Materials:** Soil, seeds, grow lights, terrarium kits, decomposer samples (worms/fungi).
*   **Digital:** Food web simulation tools.
