title: Unit 2: Structure and Properties of Matter
course: Grade 5 Science
unit: 2
---

I. Unit Overview
This unit explores the nature of matter, focusing on particle theory, states of matter, physical and chemical changes, and the law of conservation of mass. Students will engage in hands-on investigations to mix substances and observe changes.

II. Big Ideas & Essential Questions
- **Big Idea**: Matter is made of particles and changes can conserve or alter its structure.
- **Essential Questions**:
  1. How does matter change?
  2. What properties define materials?

III. Standards Alignment
- **5-PS1-1**: Develop a model to describe that matter is made of particles too small to be seen.
- **5-PS1-2**: Measure and graph quantities to provide evidence that regardless of the type of change that occurs when heating, cooling, or mixing substances, the total weight of matter is conserved.
- **5-PS1-3**: Make observations and measurements to identify materials based on their properties.
- **5-PS1-4**: Conduct an investigation to determine whether the mixing of two or more substances results in new substances.

IV. Lesson Sequence
- **Lesson 4**: States of Matter
- **Lesson 5**: Physical vs Chemical Changes
- **Lesson 6**: Conservation of Matter
- **Lesson 7**: Mixtures and Solutions

V. Assessment Framework
- **Formative**: Quick sorts, lab data sheets, concept checks.
- **Summative**: Unit quiz, Lab report on mixing substances.

VI. Differentiation & Accessibility
- **ELL**: Illustrated vocabulary for states of matter, realia for mixing observations.
- **SPED**: Guided data collection sheets, pre-measured materials.

VII. Cross-Curricular Connections
- **Math**: Measurement (mass, volume), graphing data.

VIII. Teacher Implementation Notes
- Prepare materials for mixing stations in advance.
- Safety goggles are required for chemical change investigations.
