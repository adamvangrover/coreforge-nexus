# Unit 3: Earth’s Systems and Human Impact

## I. Unit Overview
Focusing on the macro-systems of the planet, this unit explores the interactions between the geosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere. It emphasizes system modeling and data analysis regarding water distribution.

## II. Standards Alignment
*   **5-ESS2-1:** Develop a model using an example to describe ways the geosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and/or atmosphere interact.
*   **5-ESS2-2:** Describe and graph the amounts and percentages of water and fresh water in various reservoirs to provide evidence about the distribution of water on Earth.
*   **5-ESS3-1:** Obtain and combine information about ways individual communities use science ideas to protect the Earth’s resources and environment.

## III. Key Concepts & Essential Questions
*   **Concepts:** The Four Spheres, Water Cycle, Resource Conservation, System Interactions.
*   **Essential Questions:**
    *   How does a change in the atmosphere affect the biosphere?
    *   If Earth is "the water planet," why is fresh water so scarce?

## IV. Mandated Investigation: "Cloud in a Bottle"
*   **Objective:** Students model the formation of clouds to understand the interaction between the atmosphere (air pressure), hydrosphere (water vapor), and geosphere (dust nuclei).
*   **Pacing:** Week 20 (March)

## V. Resources
*   **Materials:** 1-liter clear bottles, warm water, matches/smoke source, pressure caps/pumps.
*   **Digital:** NOAA weather data portals.
