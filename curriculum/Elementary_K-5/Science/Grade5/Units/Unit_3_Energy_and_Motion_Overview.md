title: Unit 3: Energy and Motion
course: Grade 5 Science
unit: 3
---

I. Unit Overview
In this unit, students investigate energy transfer, forms of energy (thermal, electrical, mechanical), and the relationship between forces and motion. They will explore how energy moves through systems and how forces like gravity and friction affect objects.

II. Big Ideas & Essential Questions
- **Big Idea**: Energy changes form and affects motion.
- **Essential Questions**:
  1. How does energy move through systems?
  2. How do forces influence motion?

III. Standards Alignment
- **5-PS3-1**: Use models to describe that energy in animals’ food (used for body repair, growth, motion, and to maintain body warmth) was once energy from the sun. (Broadened to general energy concepts in this unit)
- **5-PS2-1**: Support an argument that the gravitational force exerted by Earth on objects is directed down.

IV. Lesson Sequence
- **Lesson 8**: Forms of Energy
- **Lesson 9**: Forces and Motion
- **Lesson 10**: Patterns of Motion

V. Assessment Framework
- **Formative**: Station notes, force diagrams, predictions.
- **Summative**: Performance lab (circuit or motion task), Concept map.

VI. Differentiation & Accessibility
- **ELL**: Video demonstrations of forces, labeled diagrams.
- **SPED**: Simplified circuit components, large-grip manipulatives.

VII. Cross-Curricular Connections
- **Math**: Analyzing patterns in data, graphing speed/distance.

VIII. Teacher Implementation Notes
- Use ample hands-on materials for circuit building and motion experiments.
- Connect energy concepts to everyday examples (light, heat, movement).
