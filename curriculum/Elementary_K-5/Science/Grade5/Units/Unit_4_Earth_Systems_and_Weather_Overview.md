I. Unit Overview
This unit focuses on the interactions between Earth's major systems: geosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere. Students will study the water cycle, weather patterns, climate, and natural hazards, understanding how these systems shape our planet.

II. Big Ideas & Essential Questions
- **Big Idea**: Earth systems interact and shape weather, climate, and natural events.
- **Essential Questions**:
  1. How do Earth’s systems interact?
  2. What causes natural hazards?

III. Standards Alignment
- **5-ESS2-1**: Develop a model using an example to describe ways the geosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and/or atmosphere interact.
- **5-ESS3-1**: Obtain and combine information about ways individual communities use science ideas to protect the Earth’s resources and environment.

IV. Lesson Sequence
- **Lesson 11**: Earth’s Systems
- **Lesson 12**: Water Cycle & Weather
- **Lesson 13**: Climate vs Weather
- **Lesson 14**: Natural Hazards

V. Assessment Framework
- **Formative**: Systems interaction diagram, weather log.
- **Summative**: Project-based assessment (Natural Hazard Preparedness), Data analysis.

VI. Differentiation & Accessibility
- **ELL**: Visual water cycle maps, cognates for system names (geo, hydro, bio, atmo).
- **SPED**: Color-coded system cards, tactile models of Earth layers.

VII. Cross-Curricular Connections
- **Social Studies**: Geography, human impact on environment.
- **ELA**: Researching natural hazards.

VIII. Teacher Implementation Notes
- Use local weather data to make learning relevant.
- Encourage students to observe interactions in their schoolyard.
