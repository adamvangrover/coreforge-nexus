# Unit 4: Space Systems: Stars and the Solar System

## I. Unit Overview
This unit addresses the patterns of the Earth-Sun-Moon system and the physical science of gravity and energy. It integrates the "Light It Up" energy investigation to contrast macro-scale solar energy with micro-scale electrical energy.

## II. Standards Alignment
*   **5-PS2-1:** Support an argument that the gravitational force exerted by Earth on objects is directed down.
*   **5-ESS1-1:** Support an argument that differences in the apparent brightness of the sun compared to other stars is due to their relative distances from the Earth.
*   **5-ESS1-2:** Represent data in graphical displays to reveal patterns of daily changes in length and direction of shadows, day and night, and the seasonal appearance of some stars in the night sky.
*   **Integrated Energy (4-PS3/5-ETS1):** Energy transfer and circuit design.

## III. Key Concepts & Essential Questions
*   **Concepts:** Gravity, Orbit/Rotation, Stellar Brightness, Circuitry, Energy Transfer.
*   **Essential Questions:**
    *   Why do shadows get longer in the winter?
    *   Why does the sun look so much brighter than other stars?
    *   What keeps us on the ground?

## IV. Mandated Investigation: "Light It Up"
*   **Objective:** Students design and test electric circuits to demonstrate energy transfer and transformation (Electrical -> Light/Heat), emphasizing engineering design.
*   **Pacing:** Week 12 (December)

## V. Resources
*   **Materials:** Flashlights, globes, shadow sticks, batteries, wires, bulbs.
*   **Digital:** Stellarium or other sky map software.
