course: Grade 5 Science
unit: 5
---

I. Unit Overview
Students explore the complex relationships within ecosystems, focusing on the flow of energy from the sun to producers, consumers, and decomposers. They will analyze food webs, study organism adaptations, and investigate human impacts on the environment.

II. Big Ideas & Essential Questions
- **Big Idea**: Living organisms depend on each other for energy and survival.
- **Essential Questions**:
  1. How does energy flow in ecosystems?
  2. How do organisms survive?

III. Standards Alignment
- **5-LS2-1**: Develop a model to describe the movement of matter among plants, animals, decomposers, and the environment.
- **5-LS1-1**: Support an argument that plants get the materials they need for growth chiefly from air and water.

IV. Lesson Sequence
- **Lesson 15**: Energy in Ecosystems
- **Lesson 16**: Food Webs
- **Lesson 17**: Human Impact on Ecosystems
- **Lesson 18**: Adaptations and Survival

V. Assessment Framework
- **Formative**: Food chain construction, adaptation matching.
- **Summative**: Food web modeling project, Short research project on human impact.

VI. Differentiation & Accessibility
- **ELL**: Picture cards for organisms, arrows to show energy flow.
- **SPED**: Pre-cut organism cards for webs, sentence frames for explanations.

VII. Cross-Curricular Connections
- **ELA**: Reading informational text about ecosystems.
- **Social Studies**: Human geography and environmental stewardship.

VIII. Teacher Implementation Notes
- Use a local ecosystem example (e.g., park, pond) if possible.
- Clarify the direction of arrows in food webs (energy flow, not "who eats who").
