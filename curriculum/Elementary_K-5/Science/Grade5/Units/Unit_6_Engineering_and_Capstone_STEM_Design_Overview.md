title: Unit 6: Engineering and Capstone STEM Design
course: Grade 5 Science
unit: 6
---

I. Unit Overview
This culminating unit engages students in the engineering design process. They will define problems, brainstorm solutions, test prototypes, and iterate on their designs. The unit concludes with a Capstone STEM Project integrating concepts from previous units.

II. Big Ideas & Essential Questions
- **Big Idea**: Engineering uses science to solve real-world problems.
- **Essential Questions**:
  1. How can we solve problems using science?
  2. How do we test and improve designs?

III. Standards Alignment
- **5-ETS1-1**: Define a simple design problem reflecting a need or a want that includes specified criteria for success and constraints on materials, time, or cost.
- **5-ETS1-2**: Generate and compare multiple possible solutions to a problem based on how well each is likely to meet the criteria and constraints of the problem.
- **5-ETS1-3**: Plan and carry out fair tests in which variables are controlled and failure points are considered to identify aspects of a model or prototype that can be improved.

IV. Lesson Sequence
- **Lesson 19**: Engineering Design Process
- **Lesson 20**: Capstone STEM Project

V. Assessment Framework
- **Formative**: Design sketches, prototype testing notes.
- **Summative**: Capstone project presentation, Design portfolio.

VI. Differentiation & Accessibility
- **ELL**: Visual design cycle guide, collaborative group roles.
- **SPED**: Structured design templates, hands-on building support.

VII. Cross-Curricular Connections
- **Math**: Measuring materials, budgeting (constraints).
- **ELA**: Presenting solutions and persuasive speaking.

VIII. Teacher Implementation Notes
- Allow for failure as part of the learning process (iteration).
- Ensure sufficient materials for building prototypes.
