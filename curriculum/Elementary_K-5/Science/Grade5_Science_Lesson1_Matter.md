## I. Lesson Overview

*   **Subject:** Science
*   **Grade Level:** 5
*   **Topic:** Structure and Properties of Matter
*   **Estimated Duration:** 45 minutes

## II. Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

1.  Describe that matter is made of particles too small to be seen.
2.  Explain that matter has mass and takes up space.
3.  Identify different states of matter (solid, liquid, gas) based on particle arrangement.

## III. Standards Alignment

*   **State Standards:** 5-PS1-1: Develop a model to describe that matter is made of particles too small to be seen.
*   **Skill Focus:** Developing and Using Models, Engaging in Argument from Evidence.

## IV. Materials Needed

*   Balloons (deflated and inflated)
*   Sugar cubes
*   Clear cups of water
*   Magnifying glasses
*   Digital scale or balance
*   Science notebooks

## V. Lesson Procedure

### A. Introduction (5-10 minutes)

*   **Hook:** Show students a deflated balloon and an inflated balloon. Ask: "What is inside the inflated balloon? Can we see it? Does it have weight?"
*   **Review:** Recall from previous grades that solids and liquids are forms of matter. Today we explore what makes up that matter.

### B. Direct Instruction (15-20 minutes)

*   **Concept Explanation:** Explain that everything around us is made of "matter." Matter is anything that has mass and takes up space.
*   **Particle Theory:** Introduce the idea that matter is built from tiny particles (atoms/molecules) that are too small to see with our eyes.
*   **Demonstration:** Dissolve a sugar cube in water. Ask: "The sugar 'disappeared', but is it still there?" Taste the water (teacher only or verify safety). The sweetness proves the sugar particles are still present, just spread out and too small to see.
*   **Visual Model:** Draw a diagram on the board showing particles in solids (packed tight), liquids (flowing), and gases (spread out).

### C. Guided Practice (10 minutes)

*   **Activity:** "Particle Acting." Have students stand up.
    *   "Act like a Solid": Stand close together, vibrating slightly but not moving spots.
    *   "Act like a Liquid": Hold hands but move and flow around the room.
    *   "Act like a Gas": Let go of hands and run/move freely around the space.
*   **Discussion:** How did the space between "particles" (students) change in each state?

### D. Independent Practice (10 minutes)

*   **Worksheet/Journal:** Students draw their own models of particles in a solid, liquid, and gas in their science notebooks.
*   **Prompt:** Write a sentence explaining why we know air is matter even though we can't see it (reference the balloon experiment).

## VI. Assessment & Wrap-up

*   **Exit Ticket:** "If I crush a cookie into crumbs, is it still the same matter? Why or why not?"
*   **Homework:** Find 3 examples of solids, 3 examples of liquids, and 1 example of a gas in your kitchen.
