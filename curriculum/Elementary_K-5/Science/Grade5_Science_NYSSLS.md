# Grade 5 - Science - NYSSLS

**Note: The content herein is a proposed draft for Subject Matter Expert (SME) review.**

## I. Overview and Alignment

*   **Subject Description:** This Grade 5 Science course is designed to engage students in scientific inquiry and engineering design. Students will explore the physical sciences, life sciences, and earth and space sciences through hands-on investigations. Key areas of focus include the structure and properties of matter, matter and energy in organisms and ecosystems, Earth's systems, and space systems. The curriculum emphasizes the three dimensions of science learning: Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCIs), Science and Engineering Practices (SEPs), and Crosscutting Concepts (CCCs).
*   **NYS Learning Standards Addressed:**
    *   **5-PS1:** Matter and Its Interactions (e.g., 5-PS1-1: Particle model of matter)
    *   **5-PS2:** Motion and Stability: Forces and Interactions
    *   **5-PS3:** Energy
    *   **5-LS1:** From Molecules to Organisms: Structures and Processes
    *   **5-LS2:** Ecosystems: Interactions, Energy, and Dynamics
    *   **5-ESS1:** Earth's Place in the Universe
    *   **5-ESS2:** Earth's Systems
    *   **5-ESS3:** Earth and Human Activity
    *   **3-5-ETS1:** Engineering Design
*   **Federal Mandate Considerations:**
    *   **ESSA:** Supports well-rounded education including science; emphasizes evidence-based interventions.
    *   **IDEA/UDL:** Content is designed with Universal Design for Learning principles, offering multiple means of representation, action/expression, and engagement to support students with disabilities.
*   **Statutory Instructional Mandates:** Compliance with NYS Part 100 regulations regarding science instruction time and laboratory experiences where applicable for elementary grades.

## II. Core Concepts / Units

*   **Unit 1: Structure and Properties of Matter**
    *   Key Concepts: Matter is made of particles too small to be seen; conservation of matter; physical and chemical changes.
    *   Learning Objectives: Students will develop a model to describe that matter is made of particles; measure and graph quantities to provide evidence that the total weight of matter is conserved.
    *   Essential Questions: What is the universe made of? How can we identify materials based on their properties?
*   **Unit 2: Matter and Energy in Organisms and Ecosystems**
    *   Key Concepts: Photosynthesis (energy from the sun); movement of matter among plants, animals, decomposers, and the environment.
    *   Learning Objectives: Students will support an argument that plants get the materials they need for growth chiefly from air and water.
    *   Essential Questions: Where does the energy in food come from and what is it used for?
*   **Unit 3: Earth's Systems**
    *   Key Concepts: Geosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere interactions; distribution of water on Earth.
    *   Learning Objectives: Students will develop a model using an example to describe ways the geosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and/or atmosphere interact.
    *   Essential Questions: How do the major systems of Earth interact?
*   **Unit 4: Space Systems: Stars and the Solar System**
    *   Key Concepts: Gravitational force; apparent brightness of stars; patterns of daily changes in length and direction of shadows, day and night, and seasonal appearance of some stars.
    *   Learning Objectives: Students will represent data in graphical displays to reveal patterns of daily changes.
    *   Essential Questions: What are the predictable patterns caused by Earth's movement in the solar system?

## III. Instructional Strategies & Resources

*   **Key Pedagogical Approaches:**
    *   **Inquiry-Based Learning:** Students ask questions and construct explanations.
    *   **Phenomenon-Based Learning:** Starting units with an anchoring phenomenon (e.g., "Why does the water in a puddle disappear?").
    *   **Engineering Design Process:** Defining problems and designing solutions (3-5-ETS1).
*   **Potential Interdisciplinary Connections:**
    *   **Mathematics:** Measuring, graphing data (5.MD.A.1, 5.MD.C.3).
    *   **ELA:** Reading informational texts, writing arguments based on evidence (RI.5.7, W.5.1).
*   **Supplemental Materials:**
    *   Digital simulations (e.g., PhET).
    *   Science notebooks for journaling.
    *   Hands-on materials: balances, graduated cylinders, various samples of matter.

## IV. Assessment Strategies

*   **Formative Assessments:**
    *   Science notebook entries and diagrams.
    *   "Think-Pair-Share" discussions.
    *   Exit tickets checking for understanding of key vocabulary.
*   **Summative Assessments:**
    *   End-of-unit performance tasks (e.g., designing a water filtration system).
    *   Written explanations of phenomena using the CER (Claim-Evidence-Reasoning) framework.
*   **Accommodations (IDEA/504):**
    *   Simplified texts or audio versions of reading materials.
    *   Graphic organizers for structuring arguments.
    *   Extended time for observations and data collection.
*   **ELL Support Strategies:**
    *   Word walls with visual aids.
    *   Sentence frames for scientific discourse (e.g., "I observed that...", "My evidence is...").
    *   Partner work with native English speakers.
