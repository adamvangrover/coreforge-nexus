# Grade 4 - Social Studies - NYS K-12 Social Studies Framework
**Note: The content herein is a proposed draft for Subject Matter Expert (SME) review and expansion.**

## I. Overview and Alignment
*   **Subject Description:** Fourth-grade social studies focuses on New York State history and government. Students explore the diverse geography of the state, the history of its Native American inhabitants, European colonization, New York's role in the American Revolution, the development of state and local government, and significant economic and social changes. Emphasis is on developing historical thinking skills, understanding civic participation, and making connections between the past and present.
*   **NYS Learning Standards Addressed:** (Key Ideas and Conceptual Understandings from the NYS K-12 Social Studies Framework for Grade 4)
    *   **4.1 GEOGRAPHY OF NEW YORK STATE:** New York State has a diverse geography. Various people and cultures have adapted to and modified this diverse geography.
    *   **4.2 NATIVE AMERICAN GROUPS AND THE ENVIRONMENT:** Native American groups, chiefly the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) and Algonquian-speaking groups, inhabited the region that became New York State. These groups adapted to and modified their environment.
    *   **4.3 COLONIAL AND REVOLUTIONARY PERIOD IN NEW YORK:** European exploration and colonization resulted in cultural interactions and conflicts between Native Americans, enslaved Africans, and Europeans. New York played a significant role in the American Revolution.
    *   **4.4 GOVERNMENT:** The New York State Constitution establishes the basic structure of government for the state. The government of New York State has components similar to the federal government, and it serves the people of New York State.
    *   **4.5 IN SEARCH OF FREEDOM AND A CALL FOR CHANGE:** Different groups of people did not have equal rights and freedoms in New York State. People worked to bring about change.
    *   **4.6 GROWTH, PROSPERITY, AND CONFLICT:** After the Revolution, New York State’s population grew, and the state’s economy prospered. This growth and prosperity also brought challenges and conflicts.
    *   (Plus relevant Social Studies Practices: Gathering, Using, and Interpreting Evidence; Chronological Reasoning and Causation; Comparison and Contextualization; Geographic Reasoning; Economics and Economic Systems; Civic Participation)
*   **Federal Mandate Considerations (if applicable):** ESSA's focus on well-rounded education, IDEA principles for UDL ensuring access for all learners.
*   **Statutory Instructional Mandates Integrated (if applicable):** Patriotism, Citizenship, Historic Documents (related to NYS, e.g., parts of NYS Constitution, local historical markers), Civility, understanding of diverse cultures including Native Americans and enslaved Africans.

## III. Instructional Strategies & Resources
*   **Key Pedagogical Approaches:** UDL principles, inquiry-based learning with primary and secondary sources (e.g., historical maps, letters, photographs, diaries, simplified documents), map analysis, timeline creation, biography studies, virtual field trips to NYS historic sites, debates, simulations (e.g., Iroquois Confederacy council), project-based learning (e.g., creating a travel brochure for a NYS region, researching a local historical figure).
*   **Potential Interdisciplinary Connections:** Reading historical fiction and biographies set in NYS (ELA - RL.4.1-RL.4.10, RI.4.1-RI.4.10), Writing reports or narratives about NYS history (ELA - W.4.2, W.4.3), Studying population data or economic trends related to NYS (Math), Examining NYS symbols and art/music related to NYS history (Arts), Science of the Erie Canal or NYS geology/ecology (Science).
*   **Ideas for Supplemental Materials & Technology Integration:** Historical maps of NYS, reproductions of primary source documents, biographies of notable New Yorkers, children's literature about NYS history, online resources from NYS Museum or historical societies, virtual tours of places like the Erie Canal or Tenement Museum, interactive timeline software, map-making tools (Google My Maps).

## IV. Assessment Strategies
*   **Formative Assessments:** Class discussions, exit tickets (e.g., "What was one cause of the Revolution in NY?"), short research tasks on specific topics, graphic organizers comparing different Native American groups or colonial experiences, role-playing activities (e.g., a debate in the colonial assembly), map labeling quizzes.
*   **Summative Assessments:** Projects on local history or a NYS region, presentations on NYS symbols or government functions, essays or reports on key historical events (e.g., "The Impact of the Erie Canal"), creating a timeline of significant events in NYS history, DBQ-lite activities using age-appropriate sources.
*   **Accommodations & Modifications (IDEA/504):** Simplified texts or summaries of historical events, visual timelines and graphic organizers, pre-highlighted key information in readings, choice of project format (e.g., poster vs. written report), assistive technology for writing, sentence starters for written responses.
*   **ELL Support Strategies:** Bilingual glossaries for historical and geographical terms, visual aids depicting historical figures, events, and places, use of cognates when discussing concepts, sentence frames for discussions and writing ("The Haudenosaunee lived in...", "The Erie Canal was important because..."), collaborative group work for research and projects, incorporating stories or information about students' home cultures when making comparisons.
