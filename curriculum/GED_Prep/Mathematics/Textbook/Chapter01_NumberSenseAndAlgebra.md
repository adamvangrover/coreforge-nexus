# Chapter 1: Number Sense and Algebra

## 1.1 The Real Number System
*   **Integers**: ..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...
*   **Rational Numbers**: Can be written as a fraction (e.g., 1/2, 0.75).
*   **Irrational Numbers**: Cannot be written as a fraction (e.g., $\pi$, $\sqrt{2}$).

## 1.2 Order of Operations (PEMDAS)
1.  **P**arentheses
2.  **E**xponents
3.  **M**ultiplication & **D**ivision (left to right)
4.  **A**ddition & **S**ubtraction (left to right)

*Example*: $3 + 4 \times 2 = 3 + 8 = 11$ (Not 14)

## 1.3 Ratios and Proportions
A ratio compares two quantities. A proportion states that two ratios are equal.
$$ \frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d} $$
*Cross-multiply to solve*: $a \times d = b \times c$.

## 1.4 Introduction to Algebra
*   **Variable**: A symbol (like $x$) representing a number.
*   **Expression**: A combination of numbers and variables (e.g., $2x + 3$).
*   **Equation**: A statement that two expressions are equal (e.g., $2x + 3 = 9$).

### Solving Linear Equations
To solve for $x$, perform inverse operations to isolate the variable.
$$ 2x + 3 = 9 $$
$$ 2x = 6 $$
$$ x = 3 $$

**Practice Problems**
1.  Evaluate: $10 - 2^3 + 4$
2.  Solve for $x$: $3x - 5 = 16$
3.  If 3 apples cost $2, how much do 9 apples cost?
