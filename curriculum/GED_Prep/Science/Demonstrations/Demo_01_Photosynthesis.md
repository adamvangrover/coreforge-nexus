# Demonstration 1: Photosynthesis in Action

## Objective
To demonstrate that plants produce oxygen as a byproduct of photosynthesis when exposed to light.

## Materials
*   Clear glass or beaker
*   Water
*   Baking soda (Sodium bicarbonate)
*   Fresh aquatic plant (e.g., Elodea) or fresh spinach leaves
*   Lamp or direct sunlight
*   Hole punch (if using spinach)

## Procedure (Teacher Led)
1.  **Prepare Solution:** Mix a teaspoon of baking soda into the water. The baking soda provides Carbon Dioxide ($CO_2$) for the plant.
2.  **Prepare Leaves:**
    *   If using Elodea: Cut a sprig and place it upside down in the water (stem facing up).
    *   If using Spinach: Punch out 10-20 disks from the leaves. Place them in a syringe with the solution and pull the plunger to remove air from the leaf spaces (they will sink).
3.  **The Setup:** Place the sunken leaves/plant into the beaker of solution.
4.  **Dark vs. Light:**
    *   Keep one beaker in the dark (Control).
    *   Place the other beaker directly under a strong lamp (Experimental).
5.  **Observation:** Watch for 10-15 minutes.

## What Happens?
*   In the light, the leaves will begin to produce bubbles (Oxygen).
*   If using spinach disks, they will start to **float** to the top as the oxygen gas fills the leaf tissue.
*   The setup in the dark will show little to no activity.

## Discussion Points
1.  **Chemical Equation:** $6CO_2 + 6H_2O + Light \rightarrow C_6H_{12}O_6 (Sugar) + 6O_2 (Oxygen)$
2.  **Energy Transformation:** Radiant Energy (Light) is converted into Chemical Energy (Sugar).
3.  **Why did they float?** The production of Oxygen gas creates buoyancy.

## Safety
*   Keep water away from the electrical lamp cord.
