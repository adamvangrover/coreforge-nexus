# Experiment 1: Building a Plant Cell Model

## Objective
To visualize and understand the structure and function of plant cell organelles by constructing a 3D model.

## Materials
*   Ziploc bags (represents Cell Membrane)
*   Clear hair gel or gelatin (represents Cytoplasm)
*   Green grapes or green beads (Chloroplasts)
*   Small balloon filled with water (Large Central Vacuole)
*   Kidney beans (Mitochondria)
*   Round bead or ping pong ball (Nucleus)
*   Cardboard box or Tupperware container (Cell Wall - rigid structure)
*   Labels and markers

## Procedure
1.  **Prepare the "Cytoplasm":** Fill the Ziploc bag halfway with hair gel. This represents the jelly-like substance where organelles float.
2.  **Add the "Nucleus":** Place the ping pong ball inside the gel. This controls the cell's activities.
3.  **Add Energy Converters:**
    *   Add kidney beans for **Mitochondria** (Powerhouse).
    *   Add green grapes for **Chloroplasts** (Photosynthesis).
4.  **Add Storage:** Place the water-filled balloon inside. This is the **Vacuole** which stores water and maintains pressure.
5.  **Seal the "Membrane":** Close the Ziploc bag tight. The bag itself is the **Cell Membrane**.
6.  **Add Structure:** Place the entire bag into the cardboard box or Tupperware. This rigid outer layer represents the **Cell Wall**, unique to plant cells.
7.  **Label:** Create flags or sticky notes to label each part of your model.

## Analysis Questions
1.  Why did we use a rigid container (box) for the plant cell but wouldn't need one for an animal cell?
2.  What would happen to the plant cell if the large vacuole (balloon) was empty?
3.  Which "organelle" in your model was the most difficult to represent and why?

## Rubric for Success
*   **Accuracy:** All key organelles included and correctly identified.
*   **Creativity:** Effective use of materials to represent function.
*   **Analysis:** Questions answered correctly with scientific reasoning.
