# Lesson Plan: Cell Structure and Function

## 1. Lesson Overview
This lesson introduces students to the fundamental unit of life: the cell. Students will distinguish between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells and identify the functions of major organelles in plant and animal cells.

## 2. Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
*   Define the Cell Theory.
*   Compare and contrast prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.
*   Identify and label key organelles (nucleus, mitochondria, ribosome, cell membrane, chloroplast, cell wall).
*   Explain the function of each organelle.

## 3. Standards Alignment (GED Assessment Targets)
*   **Life Science:** L.1.a - Describe the basic units of life and their functions.
*   **Scientific Practices:** SP.2 - Reason with scientific information.

## 4. Materials Needed
*   CoreForge Nexus Textbook: Chapter 1.
*   Projector/Screen for diagrams.
*   "Cell City" Analogy Worksheet.
*   Microscopes (optional) or prepared slides images.

## 5. Lesson Procedure

### Introduction (10 mins)
*   **Hook:** Ask students, "What makes a brick building different from a human body?" Discuss the concept of "building blocks."
*   Introduce the **Cell Theory**.

### Direct Instruction (20 mins)
*   Use the Textbook (Section 1.1) to define Prokaryotes vs. Eukaryotes.
*   **Visual Aid:** Display side-by-side diagrams of Animal and Plant cells.
*   Walk through key organelles, using the "Cell City" analogy:
    *   **Nucleus:** City Hall (Control center).
    *   **Mitochondria:** Power Plant (Energy).
    *   **Cell Membrane:** City Limits/Guards (Border control).
    *   **Ribosomes:** Factories (Making products/proteins).

### Guided Practice (15 mins)
*   **Activity:** Venn Diagram. Have students work in pairs to fill out a Venn Diagram comparing Plant and Animal cells.
*   Review answers as a class. Key differences: Chloroplasts, Cell Wall, Large Vacuole (Plants).

### Independent Practice (10 mins)
*   **Worksheet:** Students complete a labeling diagram of a cell and match organelles to their functions.

### Closure (5 mins)
*   **Exit Ticket:** Answer the question: "Why do plant cells need chloroplasts but animal cells do not?"

## 6. Assessment
*   Formative: Venn Diagram participation.
*   Summative: Exit Ticket accuracy.
