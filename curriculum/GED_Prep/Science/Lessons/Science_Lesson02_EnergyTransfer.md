# Lesson Plan: Energy Transfer and Conservation

## 1. Lesson Overview
This lesson explores the concept of energy, its various forms, and the Law of Conservation of Energy. Students will calculate Kinetic and Potential Energy and analyze energy transformations in everyday objects.

## 2. Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
*   Define Kinetic and Potential Energy.
*   Calculate KE and PE using standard formulas.
*   State the Law of Conservation of Energy.
*   Trace energy transformations in a given system.

## 3. Standards Alignment (GED Assessment Targets)
*   **Physical Science:** P.2.a - Describe the different forms of energy and how they are transformed.
*   **Mathematical Reasoning:** SP.4 - Apply formulas to solve scientific problems.

## 4. Materials Needed
*   CoreForge Nexus Textbook: Chapter 2.
*   Calculators (TI-30XS Multiview).
*   Pendulum setup (string, washer/weight).
*   "Roller Coaster Physics" simulation (if available) or diagrams.

## 5. Lesson Procedure

### Introduction (10 mins)
*   **Hook:** Drop a ball from a height. Ask: "Where did the energy come from for the ball to speed up?"
*   Introduce **Kinetic Energy (KE)** and **Potential Energy (PE)**.

### Direct Instruction (20 mins)
*   Go over formulas:
    *   $PE = mgh$
    *   $KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$
*   **Math Connection:** Walk through a sample calculation on the board.
    *   *Problem:* A 2kg cat sits on a 3m high fence. What is its PE? ($2 \times 9.8 \times 3 = 58.8 J$).
*   Explain Conservation of Energy: $PE_{initial} + KE_{initial} = PE_{final} + KE_{final}$ (ignoring friction).

### Guided Practice (15 mins)
*   **Activity:** The Pendulum.
    *   Set up a simple pendulum.
    *   Pull it back (Max PE, 0 KE).
    *   Release (PE converts to KE).
    *   Bottom of swing (Min PE, Max KE).
*   Have students draw the pendulum and label points of Max PE and Max KE.

### Independent Practice (10 mins)
*   **Problem Set:** Students solve 3 word problems involving PE and KE calculations.

### Closure (5 mins)
*   **Discussion:** Ask, "If energy is conserved, why does the pendulum eventually stop?" (Answer: Friction/Air resistance converts it to heat).

## 6. Assessment
*   Formative: Pendulum diagram labeling.
*   Summative: Accuracy of Problem Set calculations.
