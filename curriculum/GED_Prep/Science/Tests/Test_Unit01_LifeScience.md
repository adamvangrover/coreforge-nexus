# Unit Test: Life Science (GED Practice)

## Section 1: Cell Biology (10 points)

1.  **Diagram Labeling:** Identify parts A, B, and C on the provided diagram (Nucleus, Mitochondria, Membrane).
2.  **Comparison:** List two structural differences between Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic cells.

## Section 2: Genetics and Heredity (10 points)

3.  **Punnett Square Problem:**
    *   A plant with Red flowers (RR - Dominant) is crossed with a plant with White flowers (rr - Recessive).
    *   **A.** Draw the Punnett Square.
    *   **B.** What percentage of the offspring will have Red flowers?
    *   **C.** What is the genotype of all offspring?

## Section 3: Ecosystems and Evolution (10 points)

4.  **Natural Selection:** Explain how a population of beetles might change color over time if they live on dark tree bark and are hunted by birds.
5.  **Food Web:** Construct a simple food chain using: Sun, Grass, Rabbit, Fox. Label the Producer, Primary Consumer, and Secondary Consumer.

## Section 4: Data Analysis (GED Style Question) (10 points)

*   **Scenario:** A scientist measures the growth of two plants. Plant A receives 10 hours of light, Plant B receives 5 hours.
    *   **Day 1:** A=2cm, B=2cm
    *   **Day 5:** A=10cm, B=6cm
    *   **Day 10:** A=25cm, B=12cm

6.  **Calculate:** What is the average daily growth of Plant A over the 10 days?
7.  **Conclude:** Based on the data, what is the relationship between light exposure and plant growth?
