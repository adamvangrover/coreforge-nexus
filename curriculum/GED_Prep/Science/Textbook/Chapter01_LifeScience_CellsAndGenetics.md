# Chapter 1: Life Science - Cells and Genetics

## 1.1 The Fundamental Unit of Life: The Cell

### Introduction
All living things, from the smallest bacteria to the largest blue whale, are made of **cells**. The cell is the basic structural, functional, and biological unit of all known organisms. Cells are often called the "building blocks of life". The study of cells is called cell biology.

### Cell Theory
The Cell Theory states three fundamental truths:
1.  All living organisms are composed of one or more cells.
2.  The cell is the basic unit of structure and organization in organisms.
3.  Cells arise from pre-existing cells.

### Prokaryotic vs. Eukaryotic Cells
Scientists classify cells into two broad categories:

*   **Prokaryotic Cells:**
    *   Simple, single-celled organisms.
    *   **No nucleus**: DNA floats freely in the cytoplasm.
    *   Lack membrane-bound organelles.
    *   Example: Bacteria.

*   **Eukaryotic Cells:**
    *   Complex cells found in plants, animals, fungi, and protists.
    *   **Have a nucleus**: DNA is contained within a protective membrane.
    *   Have membrane-bound organelles (like mitochondria and chloroplasts).
    *   Can be single-celled or multicellular.

### Plant vs. Animal Cells
While both are eukaryotic, there are key differences:

| Feature | Animal Cell | Plant Cell |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cell Wall** | Absent | Present (Rigid, made of cellulose) |
| **Chloroplasts** | Absent | Present (Site of photosynthesis) |
| **Vacuoles** | Small or absent | Large central vacuole (for water storage) |
| **Shape** | Irregular or round | Rectangular or cubic (fixed shape) |

### Key Organelles and Their Functions
*   **Nucleus:** The "brain" of the cell; contains genetic material (DNA).
*   **Mitochondria:** The "powerhouse" of the cell; produces energy (ATP) through cellular respiration.
*   **Ribosomes:** The sites of protein synthesis.
*   **Cell Membrane:** Controls what enters and leaves the cell (selectively permeable).
*   **Chloroplast:** (Plants only) Uses sunlight to make food (sugar) via photosynthesis.

## 1.2 Genetics and Heredity

### What is Genetics?
Genetics is the study of heredity, or how traits are passed from parents to offspring. The instructions for these traits are found in our DNA.

### DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid)
DNA is the molecule that carries genetic information. It is shaped like a twisted ladder, known as a **double helix**. The rungs of the ladder are made of four chemical bases:
*   **A** (Adenine) pairs with **T** (Thymine)
*   **C** (Cytosine) pairs with **G** (Guanine)

### Genes and Chromosomes
*   **Gene:** A segment of DNA that codes for a specific protein or trait (e.g., eye color).
*   **Chromosome:** A long, coiled strand of DNA. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes (46 total). You inherit one set from your mother and one from your father.

### Alleles and Dominance
*   **Allele:** Different forms of a gene (e.g., Brown eye allele vs. Blue eye allele).
*   **Dominant Allele:** The stronger trait that masks the other. Represented by a capital letter (e.g., **B**).
*   **Recessive Allele:** The weaker trait that is only expressed if two copies are present. Represented by a lowercase letter (e.g., **b**).

### Genotype vs. Phenotype
*   **Genotype:** The genetic makeup of an organism (e.g., **Bb**, **BB**, or **bb**).
*   **Phenotype:** The physical expression of the trait (e.g., Brown eyes).

### Punnett Squares
A Punnett Square is a diagram used to predict the outcome of a particular cross or breeding experiment.

**Example:** Crossing two heterozygous parents (**Bb** x **Bb**)
*   **B** = Brown eyes (Dominant)
*   **b** = Blue eyes (Recessive)

| | B | b |
|---|---|---|
| **B** | BB | Bb |
| **b** | Bb | bb |

**Results:**
*   25% **BB** (Homozygous Dominant) -> Brown Eyes
*   50% **Bb** (Heterozygous) -> Brown Eyes
*   25% **bb** (Homozygous Recessive) -> Blue Eyes

## 1.3 Cell Division: Mitosis vs. Meiosis

### Mitosis (Growth and Repair)
*   Process where a single cell divides into two identical daughter cells.
*   Used for growth and tissue repair.
*   The number of chromosomes remains the same (Diploid).

### Meiosis (Reproduction)
*   Process where a single cell divides twice to produce four cells containing half the original amount of genetic information.
*   Produces sex cells (gametes: sperm and egg).
*   The number of chromosomes is halved (Haploid).

## Chapter Review Questions
1.  What is the main difference between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells?
2.  Which organelle is responsible for producing energy in the cell?
3.  If a pea plant has a genotype of **Tt** (where T is tall and t is short), what is its phenotype?
4.  How many chromosomes do human sex cells have compared to body cells?
