# Chapter 2: Physical Science - Energy and Work

## 2.1 The Nature of Energy

### What is Energy?
Energy is defined as the ability to do **work** or cause change. It cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. This is known as the **Law of Conservation of Energy**.

### Forms of Energy
Energy exists in many forms, but they all fall into two main categories:

1.  **Kinetic Energy (KE):** The energy of motion.
    *   Formula: $KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$
    *   (where $m$ = mass, $v$ = velocity)
    *   Example: A rolling ball, a moving car, wind.

2.  **Potential Energy (PE):** Stored energy due to position or shape.
    *   **Gravitational PE:** Energy stored due to height.
        *   Formula: $PE = mgh$
        *   (where $m$ = mass, $g$ = gravity (9.8 m/s²), $h$ = height)
        *   Example: A rock at the top of a hill.
    *   **Elastic PE:** Energy stored in stretched or compressed objects.
        *   Example: A drawn bow, a compressed spring.
    *   **Chemical PE:** Energy stored in chemical bonds.
        *   Example: Food, batteries, gasoline.

### Energy Transformations
Energy constantly changes form.
*   **Flashlight:** Chemical Energy (Battery) -> Electrical Energy -> Light + Thermal Energy.
*   **Car Engine:** Chemical Energy (Gas) -> Thermal Energy -> Mechanical Energy (Kinetic).
*   **Photosynthesis:** Radiant Energy (Sun) -> Chemical Energy (Glucose).

## 2.2 Work and Power

### What is Work?
In physics, **work** is done when a force is applied to an object and the object moves in the direction of the force.
*   Formula: $W = F \times d$
*   (where $W$ = Work (Joules), $F$ = Force (Newtons), $d$ = distance (meters))
*   **Key Concept:** If the object does not move, NO work is done, regardless of how much force is applied.

### What is Power?
**Power** is the rate at which work is done (how fast work is done).
*   Formula: $P = \frac{W}{t}$
*   (where $P$ = Power (Watts), $W$ = Work (Joules), $t$ = time (seconds))
*   Example: Running up stairs requires more power than walking up them because the work is done in less time.

## 2.3 Heat and Thermodynamics

### Heat Transfer
Heat energy always moves from a warmer object to a cooler object. There are three methods of heat transfer:

1.  **Conduction:** Transfer of heat through direct contact.
    *   Example: Touching a hot stove.
2.  **Convection:** Transfer of heat through the movement of fluids (liquids or gases). Hot fluid rises, cold fluid sinks.
    *   Example: Boiling water, wind currents.
3.  **Radiation:** Transfer of heat through electromagnetic waves (space). No medium is required.
    *   Example: Sunlight warming the Earth, heat from a fire.

### Temperature vs. Heat
*   **Temperature:** A measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. (Measured in Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin).
*   **Heat:** The total energy of molecular motion in a substance.

## 2.4 Newton's Laws of Motion (Brief Overview)

1.  **First Law (Inertia):** An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.
2.  **Second Law (F=ma):** Force equals mass times acceleration.
3.  **Third Law (Action/Reaction):** For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

## Chapter Review Questions
1.  A 10kg rock is sitting on a cliff 100 meters high. Calculate its Gravitational Potential Energy ($g=9.8 m/s^2$).
2.  If you push a wall with 50N of force for 1 hour but the wall doesn't move, how much work have you done?
3.  Describe the energy transformation that occurs when you turn on a fan.
4.  Why does hot air rise?
