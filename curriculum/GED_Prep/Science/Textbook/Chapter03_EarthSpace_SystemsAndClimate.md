# Chapter 3: Earth and Space Science - Systems and Climate

## 3.1 Earth's Spheres
The Earth is a complex system consisting of four major interacting subsystems, or "spheres":

1.  **Geosphere (Lithosphere):** The solid Earth (rocks, minerals, soil, mountains, mantle, core).
2.  **Hydrosphere:** All water on Earth (oceans, rivers, lakes, groundwater, glaciers).
3.  **Atmosphere:** The layer of gases surrounding the planet (nitrogen, oxygen, trace gases).
4.  **Biosphere:** All living organisms (plants, animals, bacteria).

**Interaction Example:** Rain (Hydrosphere) falls on soil (Geosphere), causing grass to grow (Biosphere), which releases oxygen into the air (Atmosphere).

## 3.2 The Water Cycle
The water cycle describes the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth. It is driven by energy from the Sun.

*   **Evaporation:** Liquid water turns into water vapor (gas) due to heat.
*   **Transpiration:** Release of water vapor from plants.
*   **Condensation:** Water vapor cools and turns back into liquid droplets, forming clouds.
*   **Precipitation:** Water falls from clouds as rain, snow, sleet, or hail.
*   **Runoff/Collection:** Water flows over land into rivers and oceans.

## 3.3 Weather vs. Climate

### Weather
*   The state of the atmosphere at a specific place and time.
*   Short-term changes.
*   Example: "It is raining today."

### Climate
*   The average weather conditions in an area over a long period (usually 30+ years).
*   Long-term patterns.
*   Example: "The desert is hot and dry."

### The Greenhouse Effect and Climate Change
*   **Greenhouse Effect:** A natural process where gases in the atmosphere (CO2, Methane, Water Vapor) trap heat from the Sun, keeping the Earth warm enough for life.
*   **Global Warming:** The rise in Earth's average temperature due to increased levels of greenhouse gases, primarily from burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas).
*   **Impacts:** Melting ice caps, rising sea levels, more extreme weather events.

## 3.4 The Solar System

### Structure
Our solar system consists of the Sun (a star) and everything bound to it by gravity:
*   **Inner Planets (Terrestrial):** Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars. (Rocky, smaller).
*   **Outer Planets (Gas Giants):** Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune. (Gaseous, massive).
*   **Asteroid Belt:** Located between Mars and Jupiter.

### Earth's Motion
*   **Rotation:** Earth spins on its axis once every 24 hours -> Causes Day and Night.
*   **Revolution:** Earth orbits the Sun once every 365.25 days -> Causes Years.
*   **Tilt:** Earth's axis is tilted 23.5 degrees. This tilt causes **Seasons** as different parts of Earth receive more direct sunlight throughout the year.

## Chapter Review Questions
1.  Which sphere includes all the ice on Earth? (Hint: It's part of the Hydrosphere).
2.  Explain the difference between weather and climate.
3.  What is the primary cause of Earth's seasons?
4.  Describe one way the Biosphere interacts with the Atmosphere.
