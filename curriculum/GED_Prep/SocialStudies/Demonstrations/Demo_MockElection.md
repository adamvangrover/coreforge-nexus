# Demonstration: Mock Election

## Objective
To demonstrate the electoral process, including campaigning, voting, and the Electoral College system.

## Materials
*   Ballots (paper or digital).
*   Candidate profiles (fictional or real).
*   "Electoral Votes" assigned to student groups (representing states).

## Procedure
1.  **Campaign Phase**: Assign students as candidates or campaign managers. Have them create a platform (3 key issues) and present a 1-minute speech.
2.  **Voting Phase**: Remaining students act as voters. They cast ballots.
3.  **Tabulation (Popular Vote)**: Count all votes to see who won the popular vote.
4.  **Tabulation (Electoral College)**:
    *   Group students by "States" (e.g., Table 1 is California, Table 2 is Wyoming).
    *   The candidate who wins the table takes all the "Electoral Votes" for that table.
    *   Sum the electoral votes.
5.  **Discussion**:
    *   Did the same candidate win both popular and electoral votes?
    *   How does the "Winner-Take-All" system affect strategy?

## Learning Point
This demonstrates why candidates focus on "Swing States" and how it's possible to win the presidency without the popular vote.
