# Experiment: Market Simulation (The Pit Market)

## Objective
To experimentally observe how equilibrium price emerges from the interaction of buyers and sellers.

## Materials
*   Playing cards (Black cards = Sellers, Red cards = Buyers).
*   Score sheets.

## Procedure
1.  **Setup**: Divide the class into Buyers and Sellers.
    *   **Buyers**: Give each a Red card. The number on the card is their "Reservation Price" (the max they are willing to pay). Face cards = 10 (J), 11 (Q), 12 (K), 15 (A).
    *   **Sellers**: Give each a Black card. The number is their "Cost" (the min they are willing to accept).
2.  **The Market**:
    *   Open the "trading floor" for 5 minutes.
    *   Buyers and Sellers negotiate.
    *   **Transaction**: When a price is agreed upon, they come to the front, report the price, and get new cards.
    *   **Profit**:
        *   Buyer Profit = Value (Card) - Price Paid.
        *   Seller Profit = Price Paid - Cost (Card).
3.  **Recording**: Record every transaction price on the board.
4.  **Analysis**:
    *   Plot the transaction prices over time. They should converge to a specific range.
    *   Reveal the distribution of cards dealt. Construct the theoretical Supply and Demand curves.
    *   Compare the theoretical equilibrium with the average trading price.

## Learning Point
Markets tend to self-organize towards an equilibrium price where Quantity Supplied equals Quantity Demanded, maximizing total surplus.
