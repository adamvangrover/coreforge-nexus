# Lesson Plan: Understanding Supply and Demand

## Lesson Overview
Students will learn the basic laws of supply and demand and how they interact to determine prices in a market economy.

## Learning Objectives
1.  Define Supply, Demand, and Equilibrium Price.
2.  Graph supply and demand curves.
3.  Predict how changes in the market affect price and quantity.

## Materials Needed
*   Textbook Chapter 3.2
*   Graph paper.
*   "Market Simulation" tokens (optional).

## Lesson Procedure

### 1. Introduction (10 min)
*   Ask: "Why do concert tickets cost so much?" or "Why does the price of gas change?"
*   Introduce the concept of a Market.

### 2. Direct Instruction (20 min)
*   **Demand**: Downward sloping curve. (Price up -> Demand down).
*   **Supply**: Upward sloping curve. (Price up -> Supply up).
*   **Equilibrium**: The intersection point.

### 3. Activity: Graphing (20 min)
*   Provide a schedule of prices and quantities (e.g., for apples).
*   Students plot the points to create Supply and Demand curves.
*   Identify the equilibrium price.

### 4. Scenario Analysis (10 min)
*   "A drought destroys half the apple crop." (Supply shifts left). Ask students to show on graph what happens to price (Increases).

### 5. Wrap-up
*   Summary discussion on how these forces apply to everyday life.
