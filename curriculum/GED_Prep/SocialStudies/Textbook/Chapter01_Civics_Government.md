# Chapter 1: Civics and Government

## 1.1 Foundations of American Government

The United States government is founded on the principles of democracy, liberty, and equality. These principles are enshrined in the **Declaration of Independence** and the **U.S. Constitution**.

### Types of Government

*   **Monarchy**: A form of government with a monarch at the head.
*   **Dictatorship**: Absolute authority in any sphere.

### The Declaration of Independence
