# Chapter 4: Geography and the World

## 4.1 Themes of Geography
1.  **Location**: Where is it? (Absolute vs. Relative).
2.  **Place**: What is it like? (Physical and Human characteristics).
3.  **Human-Environment Interaction**: How do humans modify/adapt to the environment?
4.  **Movement**: How people, goods, and ideas move.
5.  **Region**: Areas with similar characteristics.

## 4.2 Reading Maps
*   **Latitude/Longitude**: Coordinates to find location.
*   **Scale**: Ratio of map distance to real distance.
*   **Types**: Political (borders), Physical (terrain), Thematic (population, climate).

## 4.3 Resources and Environment
*   **Renewable Resources**: Solar, wind, timber (if managed).
*   **Non-renewable Resources**: Oil, coal, natural gas.
*   **Sustainability**: Using resources without depleting them for future generations.
