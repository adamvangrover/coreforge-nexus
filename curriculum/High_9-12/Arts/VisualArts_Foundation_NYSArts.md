# High School - Visual Arts Foundations - NYS Arts Standards

## I. Overview and Alignment
*   **Subject Description:** This foundational course introduces students to the elements of art and principles of design, a variety of 2D and 3D art-making processes, art history, art criticism, and aesthetics. Students develop technical skills, creative problem-solving abilities, and visual literacy. (Often serves as a prerequisite for advanced art courses and contributes to the 1 credit Arts requirement for graduation).
*   **NYS Learning Standards Addressed:** (NYS Learning Standards for the Arts - Visual Arts. Focus on Anchor Standards within the four artistic processes: Creating, Performing/Presenting/Producing, Responding, and Connecting, applied at the High School Proficient or Accomplished level depending on grade and course sequence.)
*   **Federal Mandate Considerations (if applicable):** (e.g., ESSA's well-rounded education, IDEA considerations for UDL)
*   **Statutory Instructional Mandates Integrated (if applicable):** (e.g., Civility, Character Education, Human Rights themes can be explored through subject matter and analysis of artworks)

## II. Core Concepts / Units (Organized by Media/Concepts, integrating Artistic Processes)
(Logically sequenced units or major topics)
*   **Unit 1: The Language of Art: Elements and Principles**
    *   Key Concepts: Elements of Art (Line, Shape, Form, Color, Value, Texture, Space), Principles of Design (Balance, Emphasis, Contrast, Rhythm, Movement, Pattern, Unity/Harmony). Introduction to art vocabulary. (Responding, Creating)
    *   Learning Objectives: Students will identify and define the elements of art and principles of design; analyze how artists use these elements and principles in existing artworks; begin to apply them in their own creations.
    *   Activities: Sketchbook explorations, visual analysis of masterworks, mini-projects focusing on specific elements/principles.
    *   Essential Questions: What are the basic building blocks of art? How do artists use these "tools" to create meaningful and visually engaging works?
*   **Unit 2: Drawing: Observation and Expression**
    *   Key Concepts: Contour line, gesture drawing, value/shading techniques (hatching, cross-hatching, stippling, blending), perspective (one-point, two-point), proportion, composition. Still life, figure (basic), and landscape drawing. (Creating, Responding)
    *   Learning Objectives: Students will develop observational drawing skills; use value to create the illusion of form; apply basic perspective techniques; create drawings that express ideas or emotions.
    *   Media: Pencil, charcoal, conte crayon, ink.
    *   Essential Questions: How can we learn to see like an artist? How can drawing be used to record observations, generate ideas, and express feelings?
*   **Unit 3: Painting: Color Theory and Application**
    *   Key Concepts: Color wheel, color schemes (monochromatic, analogous, complementary, triadic), mixing colors, properties of color (hue, value, intensity), various paint media (e.g., tempera, acrylic, watercolor - introductory). (Creating, Responding)
    *   Learning Objectives: Students will mix colors accurately; apply color theory to create desired effects; explore different painting techniques.
    *   Media: Tempera, acrylics, or watercolors; brushes, palettes.
    *   Essential Questions: How does color impact an artwork and evoke emotion? How do different paint media behave?
*   **Unit 4: Introduction to Three-Dimensional Design (Sculpture/Ceramics - basic)**
    *   Key Concepts: Form, space, texture in 3D; additive and subtractive sculptural processes; basic hand-building techniques in clay (pinch, coil, slab - if ceramics is included); assemblage. (Creating, Responding)
    *   Learning Objectives: Students will explore creating three-dimensional forms; consider how artworks exist in space.
    *   Media: Clay, wire, cardboard, found objects, plaster (depending on school resources).
    *   Essential Questions: How is creating a 3D artwork different from a 2D artwork? How do materials influence sculptural possibilities?
*   **Unit 5: Printmaking or Other 2D Media (e.g., Collage, Mixed Media, Basic Digital Art)**
    *   Key Concepts: (Specific to chosen media, e.g., for Printmaking: relief printing, stencil, monoprint; for Collage: juxtaposition, texture, found materials; for Digital Art: basic software tools, layers, digital manipulation). Repetition, multiples, surface design. (Creating, Responding)
    *   Learning Objectives: Students will learn basic techniques in a chosen alternative 2D medium; explore new ways of image-making.
    *   Media: (Specific to chosen area, e.g., linoleum blocks, carving tools, ink, brayers for printmaking; papers, adhesives, found objects for collage; basic digital art software).
    *   Essential Questions: How can different media and processes expand artistic expression?
*   **Unit 6: Art History, Criticism, and Connections**
    *   Key Concepts: Introduction to major art movements and historical periods (overview), cultural context of art, methods of art criticism (description, analysis, interpretation, judgment), connecting art to personal experiences and other disciplines. (Responding, Connecting, Presenting - through critiques/discussions)
    *   Learning Objectives: Students will identify artworks from different historical periods and cultures; engage in art criticism discussions; make connections between art and their own lives or other subjects.
    *   Activities: Museum visits (virtual or actual), artist research presentations, written critiques, class discussions.
    *   Essential Questions: Why do people create art? How does art reflect and shape culture? How can we talk and write about art meaningfully?
*   ...

## III. Instructional Strategies & Resources
*   **Key Pedagogical Approaches:** (e.g., UDL principles, studio-based learning, demonstrations, guided practice, individual conferencing, peer critiques, sketchbook development, inquiry-based projects, choice-based art options where appropriate)
*   **Potential Interdisciplinary Connections:** (e.g., Art and history (Social Studies), Art and literature (ELA - illustration, visual storytelling), Geometry in art (Math), Science of color and light (Science), Cultural art forms (Social Studies/World Languages))
*   **Ideas for Supplemental Materials & Technology Integration:** (Wide variety of art supplies (drawing tools, paints, papers, clay, sculpture materials), art history textbooks and online resources (e.g., Smarthistory, Google Arts & Culture), art reproductions (posters, digital images), digital cameras for documenting work, basic graphic design software (if applicable), online portfolio platforms)

## IV. Assessment Strategies
*   **Formative Assessments:** (Sketchbook checks, participation in critiques, preliminary sketches and plans, practice exercises for techniques, quizzes on art vocabulary or history, self-reflections on progress)
*   **Summative Assessments:** (Finished art projects (evaluated with rubrics focusing on criteria like craftsmanship, creativity, application of elements/principles, fulfillment of objectives), artist statements, research presentations on artists or art movements, portfolio reviews, written art critiques or analyses, final project demonstrating cumulative skills)
*   **Accommodations & Modifications (IDEA/504):** (Adaptive art tools, choice of media or subject matter within project parameters, visual aids for demonstrations, step-by-step instruction sheets, extended time for projects, alternative ways to demonstrate understanding of concepts (e.g., oral critique instead of written), preferential seating for demonstrations)
*   **ELL Support Strategies:** (Visual glossaries for art terms, modeling and demonstration with minimal language, bilingual labels for materials where possible, sentence frames for critiques and artist statements, opportunities to explore art from their own cultures, peer support for understanding instructions and techniques)
