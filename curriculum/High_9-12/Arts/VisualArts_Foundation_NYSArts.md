# High School - Visual Arts Foundations - NYS Arts Standards

## I. Overview and Alignment
*   **Subject Description:** Visual Arts Foundations is a comprehensive introductory course designed to provide high school students with a broad understanding of the visual arts. Students will explore the **Elements of Art** (line, shape, form, color, value, texture, space) and the **Principles of Design** (balance, emphasis, contrast, rhythm, movement, pattern, unity/harmony) as the fundamental language of visual expression. The course will involve hands-on experiences with a variety of 2D media (such as drawing, painting, printmaking, collage) and 3D media (such as sculpture and basic ceramics). Alongside studio work, students will be introduced to art history, engage in art criticism, explore aesthetic concepts, and make connections between art and their own lives, other disciplines, and global cultures. This course aims to develop technical skills, foster creativity and innovation, enhance visual literacy, and build a foundation for further study in the visual arts. It typically fulfills part or all of the one-credit Arts requirement for graduation.
*   **NYS Learning Standards Addressed:** This course is aligned with the **NYS Learning Standards for the Arts - Visual Arts**, focusing on the High School Proficient level (or Accomplished, depending on specific grade level and district sequencing). Instruction and assessment will be structured around the four Artistic Processes and their Anchor Standards:
    *   **1. Creating:** Conceiving and developing new artistic ideas and work. (Anchor Standards VA:Cr1, VA:Cr2, VA:Cr3)
    *   **2. Presenting (Performing/Presenting/Producing in NYS Framework):** Interpreting and sharing artistic work. (Anchor Standards VA:Pr4, VA:Pr5, VA:Pr6)
    *   **3. Responding:** Understanding and evaluating how the arts convey meaning. (Anchor Standards VA:Re7, VA:Re8, VA:Re9)
    *   **4. Connecting:** Relating artistic ideas and work with personal meaning and external context. (Anchor Standards VA:Cn10, VA:Cn11)
*   **Federal Mandate Considerations (if applicable):**
    *   **ESSA (Every Student Succeeds Act):** Visual arts are a key component of a "well-rounded education," fostering creativity, critical thinking, communication, and collaboration skills.
    *   **IDEA (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act):** Instruction will incorporate Universal Design for Learning (UDL) principles. Accommodations and modifications (e.g., adaptive tools, choice of materials, varied task demands, alternative assessment methods) will be provided as per IEPs and 504 plans to ensure full participation and access.
*   **Statutory Instructional Mandates Integrated (if applicable):**
    *   **Civility, Citizenship, and Character Education:** Can be explored through the thematic content of artworks, discussions about artistic intent, collaborative projects, and respectful critiques.
    *   **Human Rights:** Artworks addressing social justice, human rights issues, and diverse cultural perspectives can be analyzed and created.
    *   **Safety:** Proper and safe use of art materials, tools, and equipment is a critical and ongoing instructional component.

    *   **Mathematics:** Geometry in composition and perspective, proportion, symmetry.
    *   **Science:** Color theory (light and pigment), chemistry of art materials, biology (observational drawing of natural forms).
    *   **World Languages:** Exploring art from cultures where the target language is spoken.
*   **Ideas for Supplemental Materials & Technology Integration:**
    *   **Art Supplies:** Wide variety appropriate for units (drawing pencils, charcoal, pastels, erasers, various papers, tempera/acrylic/watercolor paints, brushes, palettes, clay and tools, carving tools, printmaking supplies, collage materials, etc.).
    *   **Art History Resources:** Textbooks, art reproduction books/posters, online resources (e.g., Google Arts & Culture, Smarthistory, museum websites).

    *   **Guest Artists/Speakers (if possible):** Local artists sharing their work and process.

## IV. Assessment Strategies
*   **Formative Assessments:**
    *   **Sketchbook Checks:** Assessing idea development, skill practice, research, and reflections.
    *   **Participation in Critiques:** Evaluating students' ability to offer and receive constructive feedback using art vocabulary.
    *   **Preliminary Sketches, Plans, and Maquettes:** Assessing planning and problem-solving before final project execution.
    *   **Practice Exercises and Technique Samplers:** Checking for understanding and skill acquisition.
    *   **Quizzes:** On art vocabulary, elements/principles, art history concepts.
    *   **Self-Reflections and Artist Statements (drafts):** Gauging students' understanding of their own process and intent.
*   **Summative Assessments:**
    *   **Finished Art Projects:** Evaluated using rubrics that address criteria such as: application of elements/principles, technical skill/craftsmanship, creativity/originality, fulfillment of project objectives, effort/persistence.
    *   **Artist Statements (final):** Written explanations accompanying artworks, discussing intent, process, and influences.
    *   **Portfolio Reviews:** Collection of best work demonstrating growth and mastery of skills and concepts over time (mid-term and/or final).

    *   Label art materials and tools in English and students' native languages where feasible.
    *   Provide sentence frames and starters for participating in critiques and writing artist statements (e.g., "In this artwork, I see ____." "The artist used ____ to create ____." "My artwork is about ____.").
    *   Encourage students to explore and share art from their own cultural backgrounds.
    *   Pair ELLs with supportive bilingual peers or proficient English speakers for collaborative tasks and understanding instructions.
