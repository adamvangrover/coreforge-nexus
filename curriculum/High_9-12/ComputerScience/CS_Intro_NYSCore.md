# High School - Introduction to Computer Science - NYS K-12 Computer Science & Digital Fluency Learning Standards

## I. Overview and Alignment
*   **Subject Description:** This introductory high school Computer Science course is designed to provide students with a foundational understanding of the principles and practices of computing. Students will explore core concepts including algorithms, programming (typically using a text-based language such as Python or JavaScript), data representation and analysis, computer networks, the Internet, cybersecurity, and the societal impacts of computing. The course emphasizes the development of computational thinking skills—decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithmic thinking—which are valuable across many disciplines. It aims to foster creativity, problem-solving, collaboration, and ethical considerations related to technology. This course can serve as a prerequisite for more advanced CS electives or AP Computer Science courses and contributes to students' overall digital fluency.
