## III. Instructional Strategies & Resources
*   **Key Pedagogical Approaches:** (e.g., UDL principles, project-based learning, pair programming, inquiry-based activities, unplugged activities to teach concepts, guided exploration of programming environments, code reviews, presentations of student projects, guest speakers from tech industry)
*   **Potential Interdisciplinary Connections:** (e.g., Data analysis in science or social studies (Science/Math/SS), Algorithmic art (Art), Modeling real-world systems (Math/Science), Ethical debates about AI (Philosophy/ELA), History of computing (Social Studies))
*   **Ideas for Supplemental Materials & Technology Integration:** (Computers with internet access, programming IDEs (e.g., VS Code, Thonny, Replit), online coding platforms (Code.org, Khan Academy CS, Codecademy), robotics kits (optional), microcontrollers (Arduino, Raspberry Pi - optional), cybersecurity education resources (e.g., CyberPatriot, SANS Cyber Aces))

## IV. Assessment Strategies
*   **Formative Assessments:** (Coding exercises and challenges, quizzes on CS concepts and vocabulary, algorithm design tasks (flowcharts/pseudocode), participation in discussions on ethical issues, debugging exercises, code walkthroughs)
*   **Summative Assessments:** (Programming projects (e.g., creating a game, utility, data analysis tool), unit tests on concepts and programming skills, presentations of projects or research on CS topics, portfolio of coding work, final project integrating multiple concepts)
*   **Accommodations & Modifications (IDEA/504):** (Block-based programming options as a scaffold to text-based, visual aids for abstract concepts (e.g., data structures, network diagrams), starter code for programming projects, extended time for coding tasks, pair programming with defined roles, access to debugging guides)
*   **ELL Support Strategies:** (Visual glossaries for CS terminology, comments in code in L1 (if IDE supports), pair programming with supportive peers, projects that allow for creative expression beyond complex language, explicit instruction in syntax and programming logic, connecting CS concepts to familiar technologies)
