## II. Core Concepts / Units
(Logically sequenced units or major topics, often with a World Literature focus)
*   **Unit 1: Voices Across Cultures: Exploring Universal Themes in World Literature**
    *   Key Concepts: Archetypes in literature (hero, mentor, trickster). Universal themes (e.g., love, loss, justice, fate, journey, tradition vs. change) as expressed in myths, epics, folktales, short stories, and novels from diverse world cultures (e.g., African, Asian, Latin American, European). Analyzing how cultural context shapes literary expression and interpretation.
    *   Literary Focus: Selections from world mythology, epics (e.g., excerpts from *The Odyssey*, *Ramayana*, or *Epic of Gilgamesh*), representative short stories and novels from various global regions.
    *   Learning Objectives (Proposed):

How can we critically evaluate arguments about complex international issues? How can we construct compelling arguments that consider multiple perspectives?
*   **Unit 3: Global Narratives of Conflict and Resilience: Analyzing Drama and Longer Works**
    *   Key Concepts: Elements of drama (tragedy, comedy, historical drama) from various traditions. Analyzing how authors use dramatic conventions (dialogue, stage directions, soliloquy, aside) to develop characters and themes related to conflict, resilience, and societal change. Exploring longer narrative forms (novels, plays) that address significant historical or social conflicts from global perspectives.
    *   Literary Focus: A full-length play (e.g., Sophocles' *Antigone*, Shakespearean tragedy/comedy, a modern non-Western play), and a novel from a non-US/British tradition that explores conflict.
    *   Learning Objectives (Proposed):
        *   Students will be able to analyze how an author’s choices concerning how to structure specific parts of a play or novel (e.g., acts/scenes, chapter organization, pacing) contribute to its overall structure, meaning, and aesthetic impact. (9-10R5)
        *   Students will be able to analyze in detail the development of complex characters in a play or novel, including their motivations, conflicts, and changes. (9-10R3)

        *   Students will be able to present complex information and findings clearly, concisely, and logically using multimedia to enhance understanding and engagement. (9-10SL4, 9-10SL5)
    *   Essential Questions: How can we effectively research and understand complex global issues or literary traditions from multiple cultural viewpoints? How can we use multimedia tools to share our understanding of global perspectives with others?
*   **Unit 5: Language as a Bridge and Barrier: Exploring Translation and Nuance (Integrated)**
    *   Key Concepts: Challenges and choices in translating literature. How cultural nuances can be lost or transformed in translation. The power of language to connect and divide. Exploring figurative language, idioms, and connotations across languages (conceptual, through translated texts). Continued development of academic vocabulary and conventions of Standard English for sophisticated expression.
    *   Focus: Integrated throughout all units, with specific attention during discussions of translated works.
    *   Learning Objectives (Proposed):
        *   Students will be able to discuss how reading a work in translation might influence their understanding and interpretation. (Connects to 9-10R6, 9-10L3)

    *   Essential Questions: How does translation affect our reading of world literature? How can we become more aware of the power and limitations of language when exploring different cultures?

## III. Instructional Strategies & Resources
*   **Key Pedagogical Approaches:** UDL principles, comparative text analysis (juxtaposing texts from different cultures on similar themes), Harkness discussions, fishbowl debates on global issues, student-led seminars on world literature, research colloquia, creative writing workshops (e.g., writing in the style of a particular cultural tradition), performance-based assessments (e.g., dramatic interpretation of scenes from world plays), digital storytelling projects reflecting global themes.
*   **Potential Interdisciplinary Connections:**
    *   **Social Studies (Global History):** Aligning literary works with historical periods and cultural developments being studied (e.g., postcolonial literature with decolonization movements).
    *   **World Languages:** Collaborating with World Language teachers to explore texts in their original language or discuss translation challenges.
    *   **Arts:** Analyzing visual art, music, or dance from cultures being studied alongside their literature.
*   **Ideas for Supplemental Materials & Technology Integration:** Anthologies of world literature, collections of international poetry and essays, translated novels and plays, primary source documents from different cultures (letters, manifestos), online literary journals featuring international authors, research databases with global coverage, video/audio recordings of performances or author interviews from around the world, virtual museum tours of international collections, tools for creating multimedia presentations (e.g., Prezi, Adobe Spark, iMovie).

## IV. Assessment Strategies
*   **Formative Assessments:** Annotations of complex world literature texts, Socratic seminar reflections, research proposals and annotated bibliographies for global topics, practice presentations with peer feedback, comparative charts analyzing themes across cultures, quizzes on literary terms or rhetorical devices in global contexts.
*   **Summative Assessments:** Comparative literary analysis essays focusing on world literature. Researched argumentative papers on global issues. Creative writing pieces inspired by world literary traditions. Multimedia presentations or documentaries on global themes or cultural studies. Panel discussions or debates on international topics.
*   **Accommodations & Modifications (IDEA/504):** Access to high-quality translations, summaries, or graphic novel adaptations of complex world literature where appropriate. Graphic organizers for comparing cultural perspectives or analyzing rhetorical strategies. Models of exemplary analytical and argumentative writing. Choice in research topics or presentation formats that allow for diverse strengths. Assistive technology for writing and research.
*   **ELL Support Strategies:** Explicit instruction in cultural contexts and historical backgrounds of texts. Scaffolding for analysis of complex syntax and figurative language in translated works. Opportunities to connect themes to personal cultural experiences and share insights. Use of visual organizers for synthesizing information from diverse sources. Small group work for discussion and project development, pairing with supportive peers. Providing access to critiques or analyses of texts in L1 if available and appropriate.
