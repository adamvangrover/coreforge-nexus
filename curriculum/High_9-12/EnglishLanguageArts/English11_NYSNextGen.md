# High School - English 11 - NYS Next Generation ELA Standards (Often American Literature)
**Note: The content herein is a proposed draft for Subject Matter Expert (SME) review and expansion.**

## I. Overview and Alignment
*   **Subject Description:** English 11 typically focuses on a chronological or thematic survey of American literature, exploring its development from early colonial writings to contemporary voices. Students will analyze how American literature reflects and shapes cultural, social, and political history, while continuing to refine advanced skills in critical reading, literary analysis, argumentation, research, and sophisticated communication. This course often prepares students for college-level ELA expectations and may align with state assessments (e.g., ELA Regents).

    *   Essential Questions: How can we engage in scholarly inquiry to deepen our understanding of American literature and its contexts? How can we construct a compelling, nuanced, and well-supported academic argument?

## III. Instructional Strategies & Resources
*   **Key Pedagogical Approaches:** UDL principles, student-led Socratic seminars, Harkness discussions, fishbowl debates, historical/biographical criticism, reader-response theory, introduction to other critical lenses (e.g., feminist, psychoanalytic, New Historicist), writer's workshops with intensive peer review and teacher conferencing, research-based presentations, panel discussions, creating annotated editions of texts.
*   **Potential Interdisciplinary Connections:**
    *   **U.S. History:** Directly aligning literary periods and works with historical events, social movements, and political developments being studied in Grade 11 U.S. History. Analyzing primary source documents from both ELA and Social Studies perspectives.
    *   **Government/Civics:** In-depth analysis of the rhetoric and principles in foundational U.S. documents and landmark speeches.
    *   **Philosophy:** Exploring Transcendentalist philosophy, existential themes in Modernism, ethical dilemmas in contemporary literature.
    *   **Arts:** Analyzing how American art, music, and film reflect and influence literary themes and periods.
*   **Ideas for Supplemental Materials & Technology Integration:** Comprehensive anthologies of American literature, critical essays and scholarly articles (e.g., via JSTOR, Project MUSE, university databases), full-length novels and plays, collections of poetry and short stories, primary source documents (letters, diaries, speeches), films adapting American literary works, online archives (e.g., American Writers Museum, Poetry Foundation), digital tools for collaborative research, annotation, and presentations (e.g., Perusall, Hypothesis, Google Workspace), citation management tools (e.g., ZoteroBib, EasyBib).

## IV. Assessment Strategies
*   **Formative Assessments:** Dialectical journals or reading logs with critical responses. Close reading annotations and analyses of specific passages. Participation in Socratic seminars and debates (evaluated with rubrics). Research proposals, annotated bibliographies, and literature review drafts. Peer reviews of essay drafts using specific criteria. Short analytical or argumentative responses to prompts.
*   **Summative Assessments:** Major analytical essays (e.g., thematic analysis across multiple texts, character analysis using a critical lens, comparison of literary periods). In-depth research papers on American authors, literary movements, or the historical/cultural context of works. Presentations analyzing historical context, literary criticism, or research findings. Timed essays (e.g., Regents-style text-analysis response). Creative responses demonstrating deep understanding of literary periods or styles (e.g., writing a Modernist short story, a Transcendentalist essay).
*   **Accommodations & Modifications (IDEA/504):** Access to abridged or adapted versions of complex texts where appropriate and available. Audio recordings of texts. Pre-reading guides with background information and key vocabulary. Graphic organizers for complex literary analysis (e.g., tracking themes, comparing characters, outlining arguments). Models of high-quality analytical essays and research papers. Extended time for reading, writing, and assessments. Choice of texts or research topics within specific parameters.
*   **ELL Support Strategies:** Explicit instruction in historical, cultural, and literary contexts of American literature. Glossaries for archaic, idiomatic, or complex academic vocabulary. Visual timelines of literary periods and historical events. Opportunities to connect American themes and literary devices to experiences and literary traditions in their own cultures. Scaffolded approaches to research and essay writing, with clear steps and models. Small group discussions to process complex ideas before whole-class participation.
