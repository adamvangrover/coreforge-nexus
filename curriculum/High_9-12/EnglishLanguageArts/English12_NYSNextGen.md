# High School - English 12 - NYS Next Generation ELA Standards (Often World Literature or Thematic/Elective)
**Note: The content herein is a proposed draft for Subject Matter Expert (SME) review and expansion.**

## I. Overview and Alignment
*   **Subject Description:** English 12 serves as a culminating ELA experience, designed to prepare students for the complexities of college-level academic work and lifelong learning. Course content often focuses on World Literature, British Literature, or specific thematic studies (e.g., "Social Justice in Literature," "The Human Condition," "Science Fiction as Social Commentary"), emphasizing independent critical thinking, sophisticated argumentation, advanced research skills, and polished communication.

    *   **Reading Standards for Literature (RL):** 11-12R2 (Determine two or more themes or central ideas of a text and analyze their development...including how they interact and build on one another to produce a complex account...), 11-12R6 (Analyze a case in which grasping a point of view requires distinguishing what is directly stated in a text from what is really meant (e.g., satire, sarcasm, irony, or understatement).), 11-12R7 (Analyze multiple interpretations of a story, drama, or poem, evaluating how each version interprets the source text.).
    *   **Reading Standards for Informational Text (RI):** 11-12R7 (Integrate and evaluate multiple sources of information presented in different media or formats...in order to address a question or solve a problem.), 11-12R9 (Analyze seventeenth-, eighteenth-, and nineteenth-century foundational U.S. documents of historical and literary significance...for their themes, purposes, and rhetorical features.).
    *   **Writing Standards (W):** 11-12W1 (Write arguments to support claims in an analysis of substantive topics or texts, using valid reasoning and relevant and sufficient evidence...Establish an organization that logically sequences claim(s), counterclaims, reasons, and evidence.), 11-12W2 (Write informative/explanatory texts to examine and convey complex ideas...effectively through the selection, organization, and analysis of content...using precise language, domain-specific vocabulary, and techniques such as metaphor, simile, and analogy to manage the complexity of the topic.), 11-12W8 (Gather relevant information from multiple authoritative print and digital sources...synthesize evidence from multiple sources to address a question or solve a problem.).
    *   **Speaking and Listening Standards (SL):** 11-12SL1 (Initiate and participate effectively in a range of collaborative discussions...propel conversations by posing and responding to questions that probe reasoning and evidence...), 11-12SL4 (Present information, findings, and supporting evidence, conveying a clear and distinct perspective...such that listeners can follow the line of reasoning, alternative or opposing perspectives are addressed...).
    *   **Language Standards (L):** 11-12L3 (Apply knowledge of language to understand how language functions in different contexts...to make effective choices for meaning or style...), 11-12L6 (Acquire and use accurately general academic and domain-specific words and phrases, sufficient for reading, writing, speaking, and listening at the college and career readiness level...).
*   **Federal Mandate Considerations (if applicable):** ESSA emphasis on evidence-based practices and college/career readiness. IDEA principles for UDL.
*   **Statutory Instructional Mandates Integrated (if applicable):** Exploration of global human rights, diverse cultural perspectives, complex ethical dilemmas, and civic responsibilities through advanced literature and informational texts.

## II. Core Concepts / Units
(Logically sequenced units or major topics, adaptable to specific course focus. Example below uses a World Literature/Big Questions theme.)

*   **Unit 1: The Human Quest: Archetypes, Epics, and Foundational Narratives Across Cultures**
    *   Key Concepts: Archetypal characters (the hero, the outcast, the sage) and journeys. Analysis of ancient and classical epics (e.g., excerpts from *The Odyssey*, *Beowulf*, *The Epic of Sundiata*, *Popol Vuh*) and creation myths from diverse world cultures. Exploring how these foundational texts address universal human questions about origins, purpose, heroism, and morality. Comparing literary conventions and cultural values embedded in these narratives.
    *   Literary/Informational Focus: Epics, myths, sacred texts (as literature), critical essays on archetypal criticism.
    *   Learning Objectives (Proposed):
        *   Students will be able to analyze how archetypal patterns are evident in foundational texts from at least three different world cultures. (Connects to 11-12RL.9, but broader)
        *   Students will be able to evaluate how different cultures use epic narratives or myths to convey core values and answer fundamental human questions. (11-12RL.6)
    *   Essential Questions: What timeless questions about human existence do foundational world narratives explore? How do different cultures define heroism and the meaning of a significant life? How do ancient stories continue to resonate today?
*   **Unit 2: Power, Justice, and Revolution: Dramatic Conflicts and Social Commentary**
    *   Key Concepts: Analyzing classical and modern drama from various cultures (e.g., Greek tragedy - Sophocles, Shakespearean tragedy/history, Ibsen, Lorca, Soyinka, Fugard). Exploring themes of power, corruption, justice, rebellion, and social critique. Examining dramatic structure, character foils, tragic flaws, use of irony, and the role of the chorus or narrator. Considering the historical and cultural contexts influencing dramatic works.
    *   Literary Focus: Full-length plays from diverse theatrical traditions. Speeches and essays on justice and revolution.
    *   Learning Objectives (Proposed):
        *   Students will be able to analyze how playwrights from different eras and cultures use dramatic conventions to critique societal structures or explore themes of justice and power. (11-12RL.3, 11-12RL.5)
        *   Students will be able to write a critical analysis comparing the portrayal of a specific social issue (e.g., abuse of power, individual vs. state) in two different dramatic works. (11-12W.2, 11-12RL.9)
    *   Essential Questions: How does theatre serve as a vehicle for social commentary and political critique across cultures? What are the different ways playwrights explore the complexities of justice, power, and human rights?

    *   Key Concepts: The role of language in shaping thought and culture. Understanding ambiguity, irony, satire, and understatement in complex texts. Analyzing the rhetoric of contemporary global discourse (e.g., political speeches, media, advocacy). Preparing for college-level reading, writing, and discussion expectations. Developing habits of mind for lifelong learning and critical engagement with texts and ideas.
    *   Focus: Integrated throughout, with specific emphasis on metacognitive reflection and application of skills to new contexts.
    *   Learning Objectives (Proposed):
        *   Students will be able to analyze how an author’s choices concerning syntax, diction, and tone contribute to the overall style and effectiveness of a complex text. (11-12L.3, 11-12RI.6)
        *   Students will be able to reflect on their own growth as readers, writers, and critical thinkers and articulate strategies for continued learning beyond high school. (Connects to 11-12SL.1c)
    *   Essential Questions: How does sophisticated language use enhance meaning and impact? How can the skills developed in ELA prepare me for future academic, professional, and civic engagement? How do I continue to learn and grow as a critical reader and communicator?

## III. Instructional Strategies & Resources
*   **Key Pedagogical Approaches:** UDL principles, student-led seminars and presentations, Harkness discussions, advanced Socratic dialogues, application of diverse literary critical theories (e.g., feminist, Marxist, psychoanalytic, post-structuralist - introduced and applied), independent research projects with mentorship, portfolio development, capstone projects, peer-led workshops, debates on complex philosophical or ethical issues derived from texts.
*   **Potential Interdisciplinary Connections:**
    *   **Philosophy:** Exploring existentialism, ethics, theories of justice in conjunction with literary texts.
    *   **History/Global Studies:** Deep dives into the historical and cultural contexts of world literature.
    *   **Political Science/Civics:** Analyzing political rhetoric, theories of government, and human rights discourse.
    *   **Psychology/Sociology:** Applying psychological or sociological lenses to character analysis and societal critiques in literature.
*   **Ideas for Supplemental Materials & Technology Integration:** Comprehensive anthologies of world and/or British literature, critical theory readers, scholarly journals and articles (e.g., via JSTOR, Project MUSE, university library access), international news sources and global media outlets, advanced translation resources and discussions on translation theory, sophisticated presentation and multimedia software (e.g., for creating academic posters, video essays, interactive presentations), platforms for online academic discussion and peer review (e.g., Perusall, Eli Review), citation management software (Zotero, Mendeley).

## IV. Assessment Strategies
*   **Formative Assessments:** Research proposals, detailed annotated bibliographies, literature review drafts, presentation outlines and rehearsals, peer critiques of capstone project components, participation in advanced discussions and debates (evaluated with sophisticated rubrics), reflective journals on critical theory application or research process.
*   **Summative Assessments:** Major research paper or capstone project (e.g., extended literary analysis applying critical theory, comparative study of global texts, in-depth rhetorical analysis of a significant speech or document). Formal academic presentations or defenses of research. Comprehensive final exams or portfolios demonstrating mastery of course concepts and skills. Leading a class seminar on a chosen text, author, or critical topic.
*   **Accommodations & Modifications (IDEA/504):** Highly scaffolded research process with clear benchmarks and individualized support. Curated lists of appropriate scholarly sources and critical texts. Models of exemplary capstone projects and academic writing at the college level. Flexible deadlines for major components (with structured check-ins). Advanced graphic organizers for synthesizing complex theories or arguments. Assistive technology for extensive writing, research, and organization.
*   **ELL Support Strategies:** Access to high-quality translations and critical analyses in L1 where possible and appropriate. Explicit instruction in advanced academic language, discourse markers for argumentation, and conventions of specific critical theories. Opportunities for one-on-one conferencing on research and writing. Peer support from proficient English speakers for navigating complex texts and academic databases. Providing models and deconstructing examples of sophisticated academic writing.
