Developing habits of mind for lifelong learning and critical engagement with texts and ideas.
    *   Focus: Integrated throughout, with specific emphasis on metacognitive reflection and application of skills to new contexts.
    *   Learning Objectives (Proposed):
        *   Students will be able to analyze how an author’s choices concerning syntax, diction, and tone contribute to the overall style and effectiveness of a complex text. (11-12L.3, 11-12RI.6)
        *   Students will be able to reflect on their own growth as readers, writers, and critical thinkers and articulate strategies for continued learning beyond high school. (Connects to 11-12SL.1c)
    *   Essential Questions: How does sophisticated language use enhance meaning and impact? How can the skills developed in ELA prepare me for future academic, professional, and civic engagement? How do I continue to learn and grow as a critical reader and communicator?

## III. Instructional Strategies & Resources
*   **Key Pedagogical Approaches:** UDL principles, student-led seminars and presentations, Harkness discussions, advanced Socratic dialogues, application of diverse literary critical theories (e.g., feminist, Marxist, psychoanalytic, post-structuralist - introduced and applied), independent research projects with mentorship, portfolio development, capstone projects, peer-led workshops, debates on complex philosophical or ethical issues derived from texts.
*   **Potential Interdisciplinary Connections:**
    *   **Philosophy:** Exploring existentialism, ethics, theories of justice in conjunction with literary texts.
    *   **History/Global Studies:** Deep dives into the historical and cultural contexts of world literature.
    *   **Political Science/Civics:** Analyzing political rhetoric, theories of government, and human rights discourse.
    *   **Psychology/Sociology:** Applying psychological or sociological lenses to character analysis and societal critiques in literature.
*   **Ideas for Supplemental Materials & Technology Integration:** Comprehensive anthologies of world and/or British literature, critical theory readers, scholarly journals and articles (e.g., via JSTOR, Project MUSE, university library access), international news sources and global media outlets, advanced translation resources and discussions on translation theory, sophisticated presentation and multimedia software (e.g., for creating academic posters, video essays, interactive presentations), platforms for online academic discussion and peer review (e.g., Perusall, Eli Review), citation management software (Zotero, Mendeley).

## IV. Assessment Strategies
*   **Formative Assessments:** Research proposals, detailed annotated bibliographies, literature review drafts, presentation outlines and rehearsals, peer critiques of capstone project components, participation in advanced discussions and debates (evaluated with sophisticated rubrics), reflective journals on critical theory application or research process.
*   **Summative Assessments:** Major research paper or capstone project (e.g., extended literary analysis applying critical theory, comparative study of global texts, in-depth rhetorical analysis of a significant speech or document). Formal academic presentations or defenses of research. Comprehensive final exams or portfolios demonstrating mastery of course concepts and skills. Leading a class seminar on a chosen text, author, or critical topic.
*   **Accommodations & Modifications (IDEA/504):** Highly scaffolded research process with clear benchmarks and individualized support. Curated lists of appropriate scholarly sources and critical texts. Models of exemplary capstone projects and academic writing at the college level. Flexible deadlines for major components (with structured check-ins). Advanced graphic organizers for synthesizing complex theories or arguments. Assistive technology for extensive writing, research, and organization.
*   **ELL Support Strategies:** Access to high-quality translations and critical analyses in L1 where possible and appropriate. Explicit instruction in advanced academic language, discourse markers for argumentation, and conventions of specific critical theories. Opportunities for one-on-one conferencing on research and writing. Peer support from proficient English speakers for navigating complex texts and academic databases. Providing models and deconstructing examples of sophisticated academic writing.
