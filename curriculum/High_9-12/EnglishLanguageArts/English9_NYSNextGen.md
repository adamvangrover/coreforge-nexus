    *   Key Concepts: Building academic vocabulary through context clues, word parts (Greek/Latin roots, affixes), and reference tools. Understanding nuances in word meanings. Applying conventions of standard English grammar (parts of speech, sentence structure - simple, compound, complex, compound-complex; correct use of verb tenses, subject-verb agreement, pronoun-antecedent agreement, punctuation - commas, semicolons, apostrophes, quotation marks). Editing and proofreading for clarity and correctness.

## III. Instructional Strategies & Resources
*   **Key Pedagogical Approaches:** UDL principles, explicit instruction balanced with student-centered activities, close reading and annotation, Socratic seminars, Harkness discussions, writer's workshop (modeling, independent writing, conferring, sharing), peer editing and revision groups, think-pair-share, jigsaw activities, project-based learning, debates, dramatic readings, reader's theater.
*   **Potential Interdisciplinary Connections:**
    *   **Social Studies:** Analyzing historical documents, speeches, and narratives. Researching social issues. Exploring themes of justice, power, and identity in historical contexts. (Connects to Grade 9 Global History).
    *   **Science:** Reading and analyzing scientific articles for argument and evidence. Writing lab reports or explanations of scientific concepts.
    *   **Arts:** Analyzing visual rhetoric in media. Exploring themes through drama, visual art, or music. Writing artist statements or critiques.
*   **Ideas for Supplemental Materials & Technology Integration:** Diverse range of classic and contemporary literature (novels, plays, poems, short stories, essays, speeches, graphic novels). Informational texts from various sources (newspapers, magazines, academic journals, reputable websites). Online research databases (e.g., ProQuest, EBSCO). Word processing and presentation software (MS Office, Google Workspace). Collaborative writing platforms. Digital portfolio tools. Online grammar and vocabulary resources (e.g., Khan Academy, NoRedInk, Quill.org, Vocabulary.com - for review). Text-to-speech and speech-to-text tools.

## IV. Assessment Strategies
*   **Formative Assessments:** Reading response journals/logs, annotations of texts, participation in class discussions and Socratic seminars (using rubrics or checklists), thesis statement checks, outlines for essays, drafts of writing with teacher/peer feedback, quick-writes on prompts, quizzes on vocabulary, literary terms, or grammar concepts, exit tickets.
*   **Summative Assessments:** Literary analysis essays (e.g., analyzing theme, character development, use of symbolism). Argumentative research papers incorporating multiple sources. Narrative essays or creative writing pieces. Oral presentations (individual or group) on research findings or literary analysis. Multimedia projects (e.g., creating a documentary short, a website analyzing a text). Debates on controversial issues related to texts or topics. End-of-unit exams combining text analysis, vocabulary, and grammar application.
*   **Accommodations & Modifications (IDEA/504):** Audio versions of texts. Graphic organizers for planning essays, analyzing arguments, or tracking literary elements. Sentence frames or starters for written responses and discussions. Text-to-speech and speech-to-text software. Chunking of longer readings and assignments. Extended time for tasks and assessments. Choice of texts or project formats when appropriate (e.g., visual presentation instead of written essay for some components). Simplified or abridged texts where appropriate.
*   **ELL Support Strategies:** Pre-teaching of key vocabulary and cultural/historical background for texts. Visual aids (timelines, character maps, plot diagrams). Bilingual glossaries or dictionaries. Sentence frames for academic language in discussions and writing ("I agree with... because...", "The evidence suggests..."). Opportunities for oral rehearsal and practice in small, supportive groups. Pairing with proficient English-speaking peers for collaborative tasks. Using texts with clear language structures and relatable themes. Providing models of exemplary work.
