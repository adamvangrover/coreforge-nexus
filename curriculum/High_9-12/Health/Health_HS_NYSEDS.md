# High School - Health Education - NYS Health Education Standards (0.5 Credit)

## I. Overview and Alignment
*   **Subject Description:** This high school Health Education course is designed to provide students with the essential knowledge and skills to make informed, healthful decisions throughout their lives. The curriculum emphasizes a skills-based approach, empowering students to promote their personal health and well-being, as well as that of their families and communities. Key topics include mental and emotional health, substance abuse prevention (alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs), nutrition and physical activity, personal health and safety, injury prevention, disease prevention (communicable and non-communicable), and human sexuality education as mandated by New York State. The course aims to foster health literacy and encourage students to become advocates for their own health and the health of others. This course typically fulfills the 0.5 credit Health Education requirement for graduation.
*   **NYS Learning Standards Addressed:** This course is aligned with the **NYS Health Education Standards (based on the National Health Education Standards)**, which are organized into three main standards, with a strong emphasis on seven key skills:

    *   **Standard 2: A Safe and Healthy Environment (SE):** Students will acquire the knowledge and ability necessary to create and maintain a safe and healthy environment.
    *   **Standard 3: Resource Management (RM):** Students will understand and be able to manage personal and community resources.
    *   **Key Health Skills (Integrated throughout all units):**
