# Lesson 1: Variables and Expressions

## I. Lesson Overview
*   **Topic:** Introduction to Variables and Algebraic Expressions
*   **Context:** This is the first lesson of Unit 1. It bridges the gap between arithmetic and algebra.
*   **Duration:** 45 Minutes

## II. Learning Objectives
*   Students will be able to define "variable" and "algebraic expression."
*   Students will be able to translate verbal phrases into algebraic expressions.
*   Students will be able to evaluate algebraic expressions for given values of the variable.

## III. Standards Alignment
*   **A-SSE.A.1:** Interpret expressions that represent a quantity in terms of its context.
*   **SEP (Math Practice):** MP2: Reason abstractly and quantitatively.

## IV. Materials Needed
*   Whiteboard and markers.
*   Student notebooks.
*   "Translating Math" worksheet.

## V. Lesson Procedure

### A. Introduction (Hook) - 5 Minutes
*   **The "Mystery Number" Game:** "I'm thinking of a number. If I double it and add 5, I get 15. What is my number?"
*   **Discussion:** How can we write this down without using words? Introduce the concept of a letter standing for the number.

### B. Direct Instruction - 15 Minutes
*   **Definitions:** Define *variable* (a symbol, usually a letter, used to represent a number), *algebraic expression* (a mathematical phrase that includes numbers, variables, and operation symbols), *term*, *coefficient*, *constant*.
*   **Translation:** Create a table of key words for operations (e.g., Addition: sum, plus, increased by; Subtraction: difference, minus, decreased by).
*   **Examples:** Translate "five less than a number x" -> $x - 5$ (emphasize order).

### C. Guided Practice - 15 Minutes
*   **Activity:** Students work in pairs to translate a list of verbal phrases into algebraic expressions.
*   **Evaluation:** Teacher writes expressions on board (e.g., $3x + 2$) and gives a value for $x$ (e.g., $x=4$). Class solves together: $3(4) + 2 = 12 + 2 = 14$.

### D. Independent Practice - 10 Minutes
*   **Worksheet:** Students complete the "Translating Math" worksheet individually.
*   **Exit Ticket:** Translate "The product of 7 and a number y, increased by 4" and evaluate for $y=2$.

## VI. Assessment & Wrap-up
*   **Formative:** Observation during guided practice, Exit Ticket.
*   **Differentiation:**
    *   *Support:* Provide a "Key Words" cheat sheet.
    *   *Extension:* Challenge students to write a verbal phrase for a complex expression like $\frac{2x+1}{3}$.
