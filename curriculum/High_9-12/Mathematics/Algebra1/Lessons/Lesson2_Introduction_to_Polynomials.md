# Lesson 2: Introduction to Polynomials

## I. Lesson Overview
*   **Topic:** Classifying and Adding/Subtracting Polynomials
*   **Context:** Students have learned about expressions. Now they will look at specific types of expressions called polynomials.
*   **Duration:** 45 Minutes

## II. Learning Objectives
*   Students will be able to classify polynomials by degree and number of terms.
*   Students will be able to add and subtract polynomials by combining like terms.
*   Students will be able to write polynomials in standard form.

## III. Standards Alignment
*   **A-APR.A.1:** Understand that polynomials form a system analogous to the integers... add, subtract, and multiply polynomials.

## IV. Materials Needed
*   Algebra Tiles (physical or virtual).
*   Worksheet: "Polynomial Party".

## V. Lesson Procedure

### A. Introduction (Hook) - 10 Minutes
*   **Analogy:** Compare polynomials to organizing fruit. "You can add apples to apples, and oranges to oranges, but you can't say 2 apples + 3 oranges = 5 apploranges."
*   **Connection:** Like terms are the same variable raised to the same power.

### B. Direct Instruction - 15 Minutes
*   **Vocabulary:** Monomial, Binomial, Trinomial, Polynomial. Degree of a polynomial (highest exponent). Standard Form (descending order of exponents).
*   **Adding:** Stack them vertically or group like terms horizontally.
    *   $(2x^2 + 3x - 1) + (x^2 - 5x + 4)$
    *   $= (2x^2 + x^2) + (3x - 5x) + (-1 + 4)$
    *   $= 3x^2 - 2x + 3$
*   **Subtracting:** "Add the opposite." Distribute the negative sign first!

### C. Guided Practice - 15 Minutes
*   **Algebra Tiles:** Use tiles to model addition. Blue square = $x^2$, Green rectangle = $x$, small yellow square = 1. Red represents negative.
*   **Practice Problems:** Board work.

### D. Independent Practice - 5 Minutes
*   **Quick Check:** Solve $(3y^2 - 4) - (y^2 + y - 2)$.

## VI. Assessment & Wrap-up
*   **Exit Ticket:** Simplify $(x^2 + 5x) + (2x^2 - 3x)$.
*   **Differentiation:** Use highlighters to color-code like terms.

## VII. Resources & References
*   NYS Next Generation Mathematics Learning Standards.
