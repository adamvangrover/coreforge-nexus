# Unit 1: Foundations of Algebra: Expressions and Polynomials

## I. Unit Overview
This unit introduces students to the language of algebra. Students will transition from arithmetic to algebra by learning to represent quantities with variables. They will explore the structure of algebraic expressions, understanding terms, factors, and coefficients. The unit covers operations with real numbers and polynomials, laying the groundwork for solving equations and inequalities in subsequent units.

## II. Standards Alignment (NYS Next Generation Mathematics Learning Standards)
*   **N-Q.A.1:** Use units as a way to understand problems and to guide the solution of multi-step problems.
*   **A-SSE.A.1:** Interpret expressions that represent a quantity in terms of its context.
*   **A-SSE.A.2:** Use the structure of an expression to identify ways to rewrite it.
*   **A-APR.A.1:** Understand that polynomials form a system analogous to the integers, namely, they are closed under the operations of addition, subtraction, and multiplication; add, subtract, and multiply polynomials.

## III. Key Concepts & Essential Questions
*   **Concepts:** Variables, Algebraic Expressions, Order of Operations, Real Number Properties, Polynomial Operations (Add, Subtract, Multiply).
*   **Essential Questions:**
    *   How can we use variables to represent unknown quantities and relationships?
    *   Why is the order of operations important when evaluating expressions?
    *   How are operations with polynomials similar to operations with numbers?

## IV. Pacing Guide
*   **Week 1:** Variables and Expressions, Order of Operations.
*   **Week 2:** The Real Number System and Properties.
*   **Week 3:** Introduction to Polynomials (Classifying, Adding, Subtracting).
*   **Week 4:** Multiplying Polynomials and Review/Assessment.

## V. Resources
*   **Materials:** Algebra tiles, scientific calculators.
*   **Digital:** Desmos graphing calculator, Khan Academy practice sets.
