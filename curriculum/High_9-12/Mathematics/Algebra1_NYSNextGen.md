# High School - Algebra I - NYS Next Generation Mathematics Learning Standards

## I. Overview and Alignment
*   **Subject Description:** Algebra I is typically the first course in the New York State high school mathematics sequence. This course builds upon middle school foundations, deepening and extending students' understanding of linear, exponential, and quadratic relationships. Students will learn to reason abstractly and quantitatively, use algebraic tools to model real-world situations, solve equations and inequalities, and analyze functions. Key areas of focus include operations with polynomials, solving and graphing linear equations and inequalities, understanding systems of equations, exploring exponential functions, an in-depth study of quadratic functions (graphing, solving, applications), and introductory statistics for analyzing data. Successful completion of this course prepares students for the Algebra I Regents exam.
*   **NYS Learning Standards Addressed:** This course is aligned with the **NYS Next Generation Mathematics Learning Standards for Algebra I**. The primary domains and clusters include:
