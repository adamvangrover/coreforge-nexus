# High School - Algebra II - NYS Next Generation Mathematics Learning Standards

## I. Overview and Alignment
*   **Subject Description:** This course builds on students' work with linear, quadratic, and exponential functions. Students extend their repertoire of functions to include polynomial, rational, radical, and trigonometric functions. They work closely with the expressions that define the functions and continue to expand and hone their abilities to model situations and to solve equations, including solving quadratic equations over the set of complex numbers and solving exponential equations using the properties of logarithms.
*   **NYS Learning Standards Addressed:** (Specific Algebra II standards, e.g., AII-N.CN (The Complex Number System), AII-N.RN (The Real Number System), AII-A.SSE (Seeing Structure in Expressions), AII-A.APR (Arithmetic with Polynomials and Rational Expressions), AII-A.CED (Creating Equations), AII-A.REI (Reasoning with Equations and Inequalities), AII-F.IF (Interpreting Functions), AII-F.BF (Building Functions), AII-F.LE (Linear, Quadratic, & Exponential Models - advanced), AII-F.TF (Trigonometric Functions), AII-S.ID (Interpreting Categorical & Quantitative Data - advanced), AII-S.IC (Making Inferences & Justifying Conclusions), AII-S.CP (Conditional Probability & Rules of Probability))
