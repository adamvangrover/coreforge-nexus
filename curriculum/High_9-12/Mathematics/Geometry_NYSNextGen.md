# High School - Geometry - NYS Next Generation Mathematics Learning Standards

## I. Overview and Alignment
*   **Subject Description:** This course formalizes and extends students' geometric experiences from the middle grades. Students explore more complex geometric situations and deepen their explanations of geometric relationships, moving towards formal mathematical arguments. Key topics include congruence, similarity, right triangles, trigonometry, circles, expressing geometric properties with equations, and geometric measurement and dimension.
*   **NYS Learning Standards Addressed:** (Specific Geometry standards, e.g., GEO-G.CO (Congruence), GEO-G.SRT (Similarity, Right Triangles, and Trigonometry), GEO-G.C (Circles), GEO-G.GPE (Expressing Geometric Properties with Equations), GEO-G.GMD (Geometric Measurement and Dimension), GEO-G.MG (Modeling with Geometry))
*   **Federal Mandate Considerations (if applicable):** (e.g., ESSA's well-rounded education, IDEA considerations for UDL)
*   **Statutory Instructional Mandates Integrated (if applicable):**

    *   Key Concepts: Area formulas for triangles, parallelograms, trapezoids, regular polygons, and circles; volume formulas for prisms, cylinders, pyramids, cones, and spheres; relationships between 2D and 3D objects (cross-sections, rotations). (GEO-G.GMD.1-4, GEO-G.MG.1-3)
    *   Learning Objectives: Students will give an informal argument for the formulas for the circumference of a circle, area of a circle, volume of a cylinder, pyramid, and cone; use volume formulas to solve problems; apply geometric concepts in modeling situations.

## III. Instructional Strategies & Resources
*   **Key Pedagogical Approaches:** (e.g., UDL principles, inquiry-based activities, geometric constructions (compass and straightedge, dynamic geometry software), proofs (two-column, paragraph, flow chart), collaborative problem-solving, visual reasoning, use of manipulatives and models)
*   **Potential Interdisciplinary Connections:** (e.g., Architecture and design (Art/Technology), Navigation and surveying (Geography/Career Tech), Molecular geometry (Science), Computer graphics (Computer Science))
*   **Ideas for Supplemental Materials & Technology Integration:** (Dynamic geometry software (GeoGebra, Desmos Geometry), compass, straightedge, protractor, rulers, 3D models, graphing calculators, online geometry tools and applets, patty paper)

## IV. Assessment Strategies
*   **Formative Assessments:** (Homework problems involving proofs and calculations, quizzes on definitions and theorems, constructions checks, exit tickets, class discussions on geometric reasoning)
*   **Summative Assessments:** (Unit tests with proofs, constructions, and application problems, projects involving geometric design or modeling, performance tasks requiring application of multiple concepts, cumulative midterms and final exams (often including Regents-style questions))
*   **Accommodations & Modifications (IDEA/504):** (Formula sheets, lists of postulates and theorems, pre-drawn diagrams for proofs, graphic organizers for structuring proofs, step-by-step instructions for constructions, use of dynamic geometry software as a scaffold, extended time)
