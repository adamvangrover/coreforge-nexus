# High School - Geometry - NYS Next Generation Mathematics Learning Standards

## I. Overview and Alignment
*   **Subject Description:** Geometry is typically the second course in the New York State high school mathematics sequence, following Algebra I. This course builds on students' previous geometric experiences and formalizes their understanding of geometric concepts. Students will explore complex geometric situations, develop logical reasoning skills, and construct formal mathematical arguments (proofs). Key topics include the foundational principles of Euclidean geometry, properties of transformations (translations, rotations, reflections, dilations), congruence and similarity of figures, detailed study of triangles (including right triangle trigonometry), properties of quadrilaterals and other polygons, circles, expressing geometric properties with equations in the coordinate plane, and calculating geometric measurements (area, volume). Successful completion of this course prepares students for the Geometry Regents exam.
*   **NYS Learning Standards Addressed:** This course is aligned with the **NYS Next Generation Mathematics Learning Standards for Geometry**. The primary domains and clusters include:
    *   **Geometry (G-CO, G-SRT, G-C, G-GPE, G-GMD, G-MG):**
        *   **G-CO.A:** Experiment with transformations in the plane.
        *   **G-CO.B:** Understand congruence in terms of rigid motions.
        *   **G-CO.C:** Prove geometric theorems.
        *   **G-CO.D:** Make geometric constructions.
        *   **G-SRT.A:** Understand similarity in terms of similarity transformations.
        *   **G-SRT.B:** Prove theorems involving similarity.
        *   **G-SRT.C:** Define trigonometric ratios and solve problems involving right triangles.
        *   **G-C.A:** Understand and apply theorems about circles.
        *   **G-C.B:** Find arc lengths and areas of sectors of circles.
        *   **G-GPE.A:** Translate between the geometric description and the equation for a conic section (circles primarily, parabolas as review/extension).
        *   **G-GPE.B:** Use coordinates to prove simple geometric theorems algebraically.
        *   **G-GMD.A:** Explain volume formulas and use them to solve problems.
        *   **G-GMD.B:** Visualize relationships between two-dimensional and three-dimensional objects.
        *   **G-MG.A:** Apply geometric concepts in modeling situations.
    *   Instruction will also integrate the **Standards for Mathematical Practice** throughout the course, with a strong emphasis on SMP.3 (Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others) and SMP.6 (Attend to precision).
*   **Federal Mandate Considerations (if applicable):**
    *   **ESSA (Every Student Succeeds Act):** Geometry is a fundamental component of a "well-rounded education," crucial for developing spatial reasoning, logical thinking, and problem-solving skills applicable in many STEM fields and beyond.
    *   **IDEA (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act):** Instruction will incorporate Universal Design for Learning (UDL) principles. Accommodations, modifications, and supports (e.g., use of dynamic geometry software, manipulatives, pre-drawn diagrams for proofs, formula sheets) will be provided as per IEPs and 504 plans.
*   **Statutory Instructional Mandates Integrated (if applicable):** Not directly applicable in terms of specific content, but the emphasis on logical reasoning and argumentation supports broader educational goals.

## II. Core Concepts / Units
(Logically sequenced units or major topics, aligned with NYS Next Gen Geometry standards)
*   **Unit 1: Foundations of Geometry: Definitions, Basic Postulates, and Transformations** (Approx. 5-6 weeks)
    *   **Key Concepts:** Undefined terms (point, line, plane), precise definitions of angle, circle, perpendicular lines, parallel lines, and line segment based on undefined terms. Basic postulates (e.g., through any two points there is exactly one line). Angle relationships (vertical, complementary, supplementary, linear pairs, angles formed by parallel lines cut by a transversal). Introduction to transformations as functions that map the plane to itself: translations, reflections (across lines, across points), rotations (about a point), dilations. Properties of rigid motions (translations, reflections, rotations – preserve distance and angle measure) and non-rigid motions (dilations – preserve angle measure but not distance). Compositions of transformations. (G-CO.A.1-5; G-CO.D.12)

Triangle congruence criteria (SSS, SAS, ASA, AAS, HL) and their use in proving triangles congruent. Developing formal proofs (two-column, paragraph, flow chart) for theorems about lines, angles, and triangles (e.g., sum of angles in a triangle, base angles of isosceles triangles are congruent, points on a perpendicular bisector are equidistant). Properties of parallelograms (opposite sides congruent, opposite angles congruent, diagonals bisect each other) and proofs of these properties. Special parallelograms (rectangles, rhombuses, squares) and their unique properties. Properties of trapezoids (including isosceles trapezoids) and kites. (G-CO.B.6-8; G-CO.C.9-11; G-CO.D.12-13 for constructions related to these figures)

Special right triangles (45-45-90 and 30-60-90) and their side ratios. Introduction to trigonometric ratios (sine, cosine, tangent) as ratios of side lengths in right triangles. Using trigonometric ratios and their inverses to find unknown side lengths and angle measures in right triangles. Applications of right triangle trigonometry (angles of elevation and depression). (G-SRT.A.1-3; G-SRT.B.4-5; G-SRT.C.6-8)
    *   **Learning Objectives (Proposed):**

Properties of chords (perpendicular bisector of a chord passes through center, congruent chords are equidistant from center). Angles formed by intersecting chords, tangents, and secants. Arc length and area of a sector (relating to radian measure conceptually). Equation of a circle in the coordinate plane: (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2; completing the square to find center and radius. (G-C.A.1-4; G-C.B.5; G-GPE.A.1)

    *   Extensively use diagrams, manipulatives, and real-world objects to illustrate geometric concepts.
    *   Use sentence frames and starters to support students in writing proofs or explaining their geometric reasoning (e.g., "Step 1: ____. Reason: ____." "The triangles are congruent because of the ____ criterion.").
    *   Model precise mathematical language and provide opportunities for students to practice using it in low-stakes settings.
    *   Pair ELLs with bilingual peers or supportive English-proficient partners for collaborative tasks, especially those involving complex language (like proofs).
    *   Allow students to explain their understanding using diagrams or constructions in addition to, or sometimes in lieu of, purely verbal or written explanations.
