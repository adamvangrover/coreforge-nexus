# High School - Physical Education Year 1 (e.g., Grade 9) - NYS Physical Education Learning Standards

## I. Overview and Alignment
*   **Subject Description:** This course, representing the first year of the high school Physical Education requirement, aims to foster lifelong physical activity and wellness. It focuses on developing students' competence and confidence in a variety of movement forms, including team sports, individual/dual sports, rhythmic activities, and personal fitness pursuits. Students will learn and apply fundamental motor skills, movement patterns, strategies, and tactics. A significant emphasis is placed on understanding and applying principles of health-related fitness (cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength and endurance, flexibility, body composition), personal and social responsibility, and the intrinsic values of physical activity. This course contributes to the 2 credits of Physical Education required for graduation, typically 0.5 credit per year.
*   **NYS Learning Standards Addressed:** This course is aligned with the **NYS Physical Education Learning Standards**, which are:
    *   **Standard 1: Demonstrates competency in a variety of motor skills and movement patterns.** Students will develop and refine skills in various activities, moving towards proficient execution.
    *   **Standard 2: Applies knowledge of concepts, principles, strategies and tactics related to movement and performance.** Students will understand the "why" behind movement, including game strategies, biomechanical principles, and training concepts.
    *   **Standard 3: Demonstrates the knowledge and skills to achieve and maintain a health-enhancing level of physical activity and fitness.** Students will learn to assess their fitness, set goals, and design personal fitness programs.
    *   **Standard 4: Exhibits responsible personal and social behavior that respects self and others.** Students will practice sportsmanship, cooperation, respect, and ethical behavior in physical activity settings.
    *   **Standard 5: Recognizes the value of physical activity for health, enjoyment, challenge, self-expression and/or social interaction.** Students will explore diverse motivations for being active and develop an appreciation for lifelong participation.
*   **Federal Mandate Considerations (if applicable):**
    *   **ESSA (Every Student Succeeds Act):** Physical Education is recognized as part of a "well-rounded education," contributing to students' physical health, mental well-being, and overall academic success.
    *   **IDEA (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act):** Instruction will incorporate UDL principles. Accommodations, modifications, and adaptive equipment will be utilized to ensure all students, including those with disabilities, can actively and meaningfully participate and progress.
*   **Statutory Instructional Mandates Integrated (if applicable):**
    *   **Health Education Linkages:** Aspects of Standard 3 directly relate to health education, particularly fitness planning, benefits of exercise, and understanding body systems' response to activity.
    *   **AED/CPR Instruction:** While often part of Health Education, some districts integrate CPR/AED awareness or certification into the PE curriculum. This would be included if mandated by the district/state for PE.
    *   **Safety Education:** Instruction on safe practices, injury prevention, and proper use of equipment is inherent in all PE activities.
