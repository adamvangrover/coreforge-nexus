# High School - Physical Education Year 1 (e.g., Grade 9) - NYS Physical Education Learning Standards

## I. Overview and Alignment
*   **Subject Description:** This course focuses on developing health-related fitness, competence in a variety of physical activities (team sports, individual/dual sports, fitness activities), and understanding principles of training, biomechanics, and social-emotional learning through physical activity. This is part of the 2-credit (4-year) PE requirement.
*   **NYS Learning Standards Addressed:** (NYS Physical Education Learning Standards - Standard 1: Demonstrates competency in a variety of motor skills and movement patterns. Standard 2: Applies knowledge of concepts, principles, strategies and tactics related to movement and performance. Standard 3: Demonstrates the knowledge and skills to achieve and maintain a health-enhancing level of physical activity and fitness. Standard 4: Exhibits responsible personal and social behavior that respects self and others. Standard 5: Recognizes the value of physical activity for health, enjoyment, challenge, self-expression and/or social interaction.)
*   **Federal Mandate Considerations (if applicable):** (e.g., ESSA's well-rounded education, IDEA considerations for UDL)
*   **Statutory Instructional Mandates Integrated (if applicable):** (e.g., Aspects of Health Education related to fitness, potentially AED/CPR if integrated into PE curriculum)

## II. Core Concepts / Units (Activity-Based and Conceptual)
(Units typically rotate through different types of physical activities, with overarching fitness and conceptual themes integrated throughout the year. This represents one year of a multi-year program.)

**Activity Unit Examples (Rotation throughout the year, specific activities chosen by school):**
*   **Unit A1: Team Sports I (e.g., Soccer or Basketball)**
    *   Skills Focus: Dribbling, passing, shooting, basic offensive/defensive strategies, teamwork, communication. (Std 1, 2, 4)
    *   Fitness Focus: Cardiovascular endurance, agility. (Std 3)
    *   Learning Objectives: Students will demonstrate basic skills and apply simple strategies in game play; cooperate with teammates.
    *   Essential Questions: How can effective teamwork improve performance in [Soccer/Basketball]? What are the key skills needed to play [Soccer/Basketball]?
*   **Unit A2: Individual/Dual Sports I (e.g., Badminton or Tennis)**
    *   Skills Focus: Forehand/backhand strokes, serving, volleying, scoring, basic court strategy. (Std 1, 2)
    *   Fitness Focus: Agility, hand-eye coordination. (Std 3)
    *   Learning Objectives: Students will demonstrate fundamental skills for [Badminton/Tennis]; apply rules and etiquette in game situations.
    *   Essential Questions: What strategies can be used to succeed in [Badminton/Tennis]? How can I improve my individual performance in this sport?
*   **Unit A3: Fitness Activities I (e.g., Introduction to Strength Training or Yoga/Pilates)**
    *   Skills Focus: Proper form for basic exercises (e.g., bodyweight exercises, introductory weightlifting if applicable; basic yoga poses, breathing techniques). Understanding FITT principle (Frequency, Intensity, Time, Type). (Std 1, 3)
    *   Fitness Focus: Muscular strength/endurance, flexibility, core stability. (Std 3)
    *   Learning Objectives: Students will demonstrate safe and effective techniques for selected fitness activities; begin to design simple personal fitness goals.
    *   Essential Questions: How can I safely improve my muscular strength/flexibility? How can I create a basic fitness plan?
*   **Unit A4: Rhythmic Activities / Dance (e.g., Social Dance or Aerobic Dance)**
    *   Skills Focus: Basic steps and patterns, rhythm and timing, creative expression. (Std 1, 5)
    *   Fitness Focus: Cardiovascular endurance, coordination. (Std 3)
    *   Learning Objectives: Students will perform basic rhythmic patterns and sequences; express themselves creatively through movement.
    *   Essential Questions: How can movement be used to express ideas and emotions? How does rhythmic activity contribute to fitness?
*   **(Other units could include: Volleyball, Track & Field basics, Ultimate Frisbee, etc.)**

**Conceptual Themes (Integrated across all activity units):**
*   **Theme C1: Health-Related Fitness Components**
    *   Key Concepts: Cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength, muscular endurance, flexibility, body composition. How different activities target these components. (Std 3)
*   **Theme C2: Principles of Training**
    *   Key Concepts: Overload, progression, specificity, FITT principle. Setting SMART fitness goals. (Std 2, 3)
*   **Theme C3: Biomechanics and Movement Efficiency**
    *   Key Concepts: Basic principles of leverage, force application, balance, and how they apply to various physical skills. (Std 2)
*   **Theme C4: Social-Emotional Learning in Physical Activity**
    *   Key Concepts: Sportsmanship, respect for opponents and officials, cooperation, communication, conflict resolution, managing emotions during competition/activity. (Std 4, 5)
*   **Theme C5: Safety and Injury Prevention**
    *   Key Concepts: Proper warm-up/cool-down, safe use of equipment, recognizing and responding to common activity-related injuries. (Std 3, 4)
*   ...

## III. Instructional Strategies & Resources
*   **Key Pedagogical Approaches:** (e.g., UDL principles, direct instruction of skills, guided practice, small-sided games, peer teaching, station work, task cards, student choice in activities where appropriate, positive reinforcement, formative feedback during activity)
*   **Potential Interdisciplinary Connections:** (e.g., Anatomy/physiology of exercise (Science/Health), Calculating target heart rates (Math), History of sports (Social Studies), Dance as cultural expression (Arts/Social Studies))
*   **Ideas for Supplemental Materials & Technology Integration:** (Sports equipment (balls, rackets, nets, etc.), fitness equipment (weights, mats, resistance bands - as available), cones, jump ropes, music, pedometers, heart rate monitors (if available), videos demonstrating skills or game play, fitness apps (for tracking or guidance - for analysis, not endorsement), CPR/AED training manikins (if applicable))

## IV. Assessment Strategies
*   **Formative Assessments:** (Teacher observation of skill execution using checklists or rubrics, peer assessment of skills, self-assessment of effort and participation, written reflections on game strategy or fitness concepts, quizzes on rules or fitness principles)
*   **Summative Assessments:** (Skills tests for specific activities, game play observation using rubrics, fitness assessments (e.g., PACER test, push-up test, sit-and-reach - as per program goals), creation of basic personal fitness plans, written tests on concepts, participation and effort grades (based on clear criteria))
*   **Accommodations & Modifications (IDEA/504):** (Modified equipment (e.g., lighter balls, larger targets), adapted rules for games, peer buddies, visual cues for instructions, choice of activities or roles within activities, alternative ways to demonstrate understanding of concepts (e.g., verbal explanation instead of written), individualized fitness goals)
*   **ELL Support Strategies:** (Visual demonstrations of skills and game play, use of gestures and non-verbal cues, bilingual peer partners, simplified instructions for activities and rules, labeled diagrams of courts/fields or equipment, positive reinforcement for participation regardless of skill level)
