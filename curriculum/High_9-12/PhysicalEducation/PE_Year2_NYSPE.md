# High School - Physical Education Year 2 (e.g., Grade 10) - NYS Physical Education Learning Standards

## I. Overview and Alignment
*   **Subject Description:** This second-year high school Physical Education course continues to build upon the foundational skills, knowledge, and attitudes developed in Year 1. The focus shifts towards refining motor skills, applying more complex strategies and tactics in a variety of activities, and fostering greater student independence in achieving and maintaining health-related fitness. Students will engage in a diverse range of team sports, individual/dual sports, rhythmic activities, and fitness pursuits, with an emphasis on lifelong participation and enjoyment. This course contributes to the 2 credits of Physical Education required for graduation.
*   **NYS Learning Standards Addressed:** This course is aligned with the **NYS Physical Education Learning Standards**, with an expectation of progressing proficiency and deeper understanding compared to Year 1:
    *   **Standard 1: Demonstrates competency in a variety of motor skills and movement patterns.** Students will refine previously learned skills and acquire new, more complex skills.
    *   **Standard 2: Applies knowledge of concepts, principles, strategies and tactics related to movement and performance.** Students will demonstrate a greater understanding and application of tactical awareness, biomechanical principles, and training concepts.
    *   **Standard 3: Demonstrates the knowledge and skills to achieve and maintain a health-enhancing level of physical activity and fitness.** Students will take more responsibility for designing and implementing personal fitness plans and monitoring their progress.
    *   **Standard 4: Exhibits responsible personal and social behavior that respects self and others.** Students will demonstrate leadership, ethical behavior, and advanced cooperation and conflict resolution skills.
    *   **Standard 5: Recognizes the value of physical activity for health, enjoyment, challenge, self-expression and/or social interaction.** Students will articulate a wider range of personal benefits and motivations for being active.
*   **Federal Mandate Considerations (if applicable):**
    *   **ESSA (Every Student Succeeds Act):** Reinforces PE as part of a "well-rounded education."
    *   **IDEA (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act):** Continued application of UDL principles, ensuring appropriate accommodations, modifications, and adaptive opportunities for all students.
*   **Statutory Instructional Mandates Integrated (if applicable):** As per Year 1, with potential for more in-depth connections.
