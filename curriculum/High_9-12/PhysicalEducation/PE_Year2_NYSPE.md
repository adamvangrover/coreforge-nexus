# High School - Physical Education Year 2 (e.g., Grade 10) - NYS Physical Education Learning Standards

## I. Overview and Alignment
*   **Subject Description:** This course continues to build on health-related fitness, competence in a variety of physical activities, and understanding of training principles. It may introduce more advanced strategies in team/individual sports or explore new types of activities. This is part of the 2-credit (4-year) PE requirement.
*   **NYS Learning Standards Addressed:** (NYS Physical Education Learning Standards - Standards 1-5, with increasing complexity and independence expected).
*   **Federal Mandate Considerations (if applicable):** (e.g., ESSA's well-rounded education, IDEA considerations for UDL)
*   **Statutory Instructional Mandates Integrated (if applicable):**

## II. Core Concepts / Units (Activity-Based and Conceptual)
(Units typically rotate through different types of physical activities, with overarching fitness and conceptual themes integrated. Activities may build on Year 1 or introduce new options.)

    *   Fitness Focus: Full-body conditioning, understanding different training intensities. (Std 3)
    *   Learning Objectives: Students will design and implement basic circuit training workouts; demonstrate safe and effective use of selected fitness equipment.
    *   Essential Questions: How can I design a varied and effective workout? What are the safety considerations for different types of fitness training?
*   **Unit B4: Outdoor Pursuits / Lifetime Activities (e.g., Orienteering or Disc Golf)**
    *   Skills Focus: Map reading, navigation (orienteering); throwing techniques, course management (disc golf). (Std 1, 2, 5)
    *   Fitness Focus: Cardiovascular endurance (potentially), mental focus. (Std 3)
    *   Learning Objectives: Students will apply navigation skills or specific techniques for chosen lifetime activity; appreciate outdoor physical activity.
    *   Essential Questions: How can I use [map skills/disc golf techniques] to navigate/play effectively? What are the benefits of lifetime physical activities?
*   **(Other units could include: Softball, Floor Hockey, Advanced Dance, etc.)**

**Conceptual Themes (Integrated and reinforced):**
*   **Theme C1: Personalized Fitness Planning** (Std 3)
*   **Theme C2: Advanced Training Principles** (e.g., periodization - simple) (Std 2, 3)

*   ...

## III. Instructional Strategies & Resources
*   **Key Pedagogical Approaches:** (Similar to Year 1, with increased student responsibility for self-assessment, peer coaching, and strategy development. Tactical games approach.)
*   **Potential Interdisciplinary Connections:** (Similar to Year 1)
*   **Ideas for Supplemental Materials & Technology Integration:** (Similar to Year 1, potentially more advanced fitness tracking tools, video analysis of performance (self or peer))

## IV. Assessment Strategies
*   **Formative Assessments:** (Similar to Year 1, with expectations for more detailed self/peer analysis, application of more complex strategies)
*   **Summative Assessments:** (Skills tests with higher proficiency criteria, tactical problem-solving in game play, development of more detailed personal fitness programs, written analysis of game performance or training principles)
*   **Accommodations & Modifications (IDEA/504):** (Similar to Year 1)
*   **ELL Support Strategies:** (Similar to Year 1)
