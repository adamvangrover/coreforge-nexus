# High School - Physical Education Year 3 (e.g., Grade 11) - NYS Physical Education Learning Standards

## I. Overview and Alignment
*   **Subject Description:** This third-year high school Physical Education course focuses on empowering students to take greater ownership of their physical activity and fitness. It emphasizes self-assessment, advanced goal setting, independent fitness planning, and participation in activities with a strong potential for lifelong engagement. Opportunities for leadership, peer coaching, officiating, and exploring community-based recreational activities are often central to this year. Students will refine complex motor skills and apply sophisticated strategies in chosen activities, while also deepening their understanding of the social, psychological, and ethical aspects of physical activity and sport. This course contributes to the 2 credits of Physical Education required for graduation.
*   **NYS Learning Standards Addressed:** This course is aligned with the **NYS Physical Education Learning Standards**, with a significant focus on higher-level application, particularly for Standards 3, 4, and 5:
    *   **Standard 1: Demonstrates competency in a variety of motor skills and movement patterns.** Students will demonstrate proficiency and adaptability in self-selected or advanced activities.
    *   **Standard 2: Applies knowledge of concepts, principles, strategies and tactics related to movement and performance.** Students will analyze complex game situations, design strategies, and understand advanced training/biomechanical principles.
    *   **Standard 3: Demonstrates the knowledge and skills to achieve and maintain a health-enhancing level of physical activity and fitness.** Students will independently design, implement, evaluate, and modify comprehensive personal fitness programs.
    *   **Standard 4: Exhibits responsible personal and social behavior that respects self and others.** Students will demonstrate leadership, mentorship, advanced conflict resolution, and ethical decision-making in physical activity settings.
    *   **Standard 5: Recognizes the value of physical activity for health, enjoyment, challenge, self-expression and/or social interaction.** Students will articulate a deep understanding of the diverse values of physical activity and advocate for active lifestyles.
