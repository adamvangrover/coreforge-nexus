# High School - Physical Education Year 4 (e.g., Grade 12) - NYS Physical Education Learning Standards

## I. Overview and Alignment
*   **Subject Description:** This culminating Physical Education course empowers students to take full ownership of their lifelong fitness, wellness, and recreational pursuits as they prepare for post-secondary life. The curriculum is highly student-centered, emphasizing independent fitness program design and implementation, exploration of diverse lifetime activities, stress management techniques, and advocacy for healthy active living. Students will apply the knowledge and skills gained in previous years to make informed choices that support their personal well-being beyond high school. This course completes the 2-credit Physical Education requirement for graduation.
*   **NYS Learning Standards Addressed:** This course is aligned with the **NYS Physical Education Learning Standards**, with a paramount focus on self-sufficiency, particularly in Standards 3, 4, and 5, while reinforcing Standards 1 and 2 through chosen activities:
    *   **Standard 1: Demonstrates competency in a variety of motor skills and movement patterns.** Students will maintain and refine skills in self-selected lifetime activities.
    *   **Standard 2: Applies knowledge of concepts, principles, strategies and tactics related to movement and performance.** Students will apply their understanding to independent activity choices and fitness planning.
    *   **Standard 3: Demonstrates the knowledge and skills to achieve and maintain a health-enhancing level of physical activity and fitness.** This is a primary focus, with students independently managing their fitness.
    *   **Standard 4: Exhibits responsible personal and social behavior that respects self and others.** Students will demonstrate self-reliance, ethical behavior, and potentially guide or influence others positively.
    *   **Standard 5: Recognizes the value of physical activity for health, enjoyment, challenge, self-expression and/or social interaction.** This is a primary focus, with students internalizing the value of lifelong activity and making plans for future engagement.
*   **Federal Mandate Considerations (if applicable):**
    *   **ESSA (Every Student Succeeds Act):** Supports PE as integral to a "well-rounded education."
    *   **IDEA (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act):** UDL principles ensure all students can develop personalized lifelong activity plans, with necessary adaptations and choices.
