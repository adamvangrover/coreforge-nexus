# High School - Earth Science - NYS Science Learning Standards (NYSSLS)

## I. Overview and Alignment
*   **Subject Description:** The Earth Science course, often taken in the first or second year of high school, provides students with a comprehensive study of Earth's systems and its place in the universe. Key areas of exploration include geology (Earth's structure, materials, processes like plate tectonics, weathering, and erosion), meteorology (atmosphere, weather patterns, climate), astronomy (Earth's motions, solar system, stars, galaxies), and oceanography (ocean currents, coastal processes). A strong emphasis is placed on understanding the dynamic interactions between Earth's spheres (geosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere, biosphere), interpreting Earth's history, and analyzing human impacts on Earth systems. Students will develop skills in scientific inquiry, data interpretation (especially using the **NYS Earth Science Reference Tables - ESRT**), map reading, and problem-solving. This course culminates in the NYS Physical Setting/Earth Science Regents Examination, which includes a laboratory practical component.
*   **NYS Learning Standards Addressed:** This course is aligned with the **New York State Science Learning Standards (NYSSLS)**, specifically the High School Earth and Space Sciences Performance Expectations (PEs). These are three-dimensional standards, integrating:
    *   **Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCIs):**
        *   **ESS1: Earth's Place in the Universe** (e.g., the universe and its stars, Earth and the solar system, the history of planet Earth)
        *   **ESS2: Earth's Systems** (e.g., Earth materials and systems, plate tectonics and large-scale system interactions, the roles of water in Earth's surface processes, weather and climate, biogeology)
        *   **ESS3: Earth and Human Activity** (e.g., natural resources, natural hazards, human impacts on Earth systems, global climate change)
    *   **Science and Engineering Practices (SEPs):** (e.g., Asking Questions and Defining Problems; Developing and Using Models; Planning and Carrying Out Investigations; Analyzing and Interpreting Data; Using Mathematics and Computational Thinking; Constructing Explanations and Designing Solutions; Engaging in Argument from Evidence; Obtaining, Evaluating, and Communicating Information)
    *   **Crosscutting Concepts (CCCs):** (e.g., Patterns; Cause and Effect; Scale, Proportion, and Quantity; Systems and System Models; Energy and Matter; Structure and Function; Stability and Change)
    *   *Illustrative PEs include:* HS-ESS1-1, HS-ESS1-2, HS-ESS1-3, HS-ESS1-4, HS-ESS1-5, HS-ESS1-6; HS-ESS2-1, HS-ESS2-2, HS-ESS2-3, HS-ESS2-4, HS-ESS2-5, HS-ESS2-6, HS-ESS2-7; HS-ESS3-1, HS-ESS3-2, HS-ESS3-3, HS-ESS3-4, HS-ESS3-5, HS-ESS3-6.
*   **Federal Mandate Considerations (if applicable):**
    *   **ESSA (Every Student Succeeds Act):** Earth Science contributes to a "well-rounded education" by fostering scientific literacy, understanding of the natural world, and awareness of environmental issues.
    *   **IDEA (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act):** Instruction will be guided by UDL principles. Accommodations, modifications, and assistive technologies (e.g., highlighted ESRT, tactile models, simplified diagrams, software for data visualization) will be provided as per IEPs and 504 plans.
*   **Statutory Instructional Mandates Integrated (if applicable):**
    *   **Environmental Awareness and Conservation:** ESS3 topics directly address human impacts on the environment, resource management, and climate change, aligning with NYS's emphasis on environmental education.
    *   **Understanding of Natural Hazards:** Instruction on earthquakes, volcanoes, floods, severe weather, and other natural hazards, including risk assessment and mitigation, is a core component.
    *   **Highway Safety and Traffic Regulation (Conceptual Links):** Discussions on weathering and erosion impacting road stability, weather conditions affecting driving, and geological considerations in road construction can be integrated.
    *   **Laboratory Safety:** Explicit instruction on lab safety protocols is crucial.
