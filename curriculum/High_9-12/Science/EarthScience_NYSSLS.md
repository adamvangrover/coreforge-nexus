# High School - Earth Science - NYS Science Learning Standards (NYSSLS)

## I. Overview and Alignment
*   **Subject Description:** This course explores the Earth's systems, including geology, meteorology, astronomy, and oceanography. Students investigate Earth's formation, structure, processes, and its place in the universe, emphasizing human interactions with Earth systems. This course typically culminates in a Regents exam.
*   **NYS Learning Standards Addressed:** (Specific High School Earth and Space Science Performance Expectations (PEs) from NYSSLS, e.g., HS-ESS1: Earth's Place in the Universe; HS-ESS2: Earth's Systems; HS-ESS3: Earth and Human Activity. Also incorporates relevant Science and Engineering Practices and Crosscutting Concepts.)
*   **Federal Mandate Considerations (if applicable):** (e.g., ESSA's well-rounded education, IDEA considerations for UDL)
*   **Statutory Instructional Mandates Integrated (if applicable):** (e.g., Environmental awareness, understanding of natural hazards and resource management, potentially aspects of Highway Safety and Traffic Regulation if discussing geology of roads or weather impacts)

## II. Core Concepts / Units (Aligned with NYSSLS High School Earth & Space Science PEs)
(Logically sequenced units or major topics)
*   **Unit 1: Earth's Place in the Universe (HS-ESS1)**
    *   Key Concepts: The Big Bang theory, formation of the solar system, Earth's motions (rotation, revolution, precession), seasons, moon phases, eclipses, stars (life cycle, properties), galaxies, scale of the universe.
    *   Learning Objectives: (e.g., HS-ESS1-1: Develop a model based on evidence to illustrate the life span of the sun and the role of nuclear fusion in the sun’s core to release energy that eventually reaches Earth in the form of radiation. HS-ESS1-2: Construct an explanation of the Big Bang theory based on astronomical evidence of light spectra, motion of distant galaxies, and composition of matter in the universe. HS-ESS1-4: Use mathematical or computational representations to predict the motion of orbiting objects in the solar system.)
    *   Essential Questions: How did the universe and our solar system form? What are the predictable patterns of motion of Earth, the Moon, and Sun? How do stars produce energy?
*   **Unit 2: Earth's Systems: Geosphere and Interior (HS-ESS2)**
    *   Key Concepts: Earth's layers (crust, mantle, core), plate tectonics (evidence, processes, landforms), earthquakes, volcanoes, rock cycle (igneous, sedimentary, metamorphic rocks), mineral properties, weathering, erosion, and deposition.
    *   Learning Objectives: (e.g., HS-ESS2-1: Develop a model to illustrate how Earth’s internal and surface processes operate at different spatial and temporal scales to form continental and ocean-floor features. HS-ESS2-3: Develop a model based on evidence of Earth’s interior to describe the cycling of matter by thermal convection.)
    *   Essential Questions: How is Earth's interior structured and how does it drive geological processes? How do plate tectonics shape Earth's surface? How are rocks formed and transformed?
*   **Unit 3: Earth's Systems: Hydrosphere and Atmosphere (HS-ESS2)**
    *   Key Concepts: Water cycle, properties of water, oceans (currents, tides, composition), weather variables (temperature, pressure, humidity, wind), air masses, fronts, storms (hurricanes, tornadoes, thunderstorms), climate vs. weather, factors affecting climate.
    *   Learning Objectives: (e.g., HS-ESS2-4: Use a model to describe how variations in the flow of energy into and out of Earth’s systems result in changes in climate. HS-ESS2-5: Plan and conduct an investigation of the properties of water and its effects on Earth materials and surface processes. HS-ESS2-6: Develop a quantitative model to describe the cycling of carbon among the hydrosphere, atmosphere, geosphere, and biosphere.)
    *   Essential Questions: How does water shape Earth's surface and influence weather? What factors drive weather patterns and climate?
*   **Unit 4: Earth and Human Activity (HS-ESS3)**
    *   Key Concepts: Natural resources (renewable/non-renewable), energy resources (fossil fuels, alternatives), natural hazards (earthquakes, volcanoes, floods, severe weather) and risk mitigation, human impacts on Earth systems (pollution, climate change, deforestation, resource depletion), sustainability.
    *   Learning Objectives: (e.g., HS-ESS3-1: Construct an explanation based on evidence for how the availability of natural resources, occurrence of natural hazards, and changes in climate have influenced human activity. HS-ESS3-2: Evaluate competing design solutions for developing, managing, and utilizing energy and mineral resources based on cost-benefit ratios. HS-ESS3-5: Analyze geoscience data and the results from global climate models to make an evidence-based forecast of the current rate of global or regional climate change and associated future impacts to Earth systems.)
    *   Essential Questions: How do humans depend on Earth's resources? How do human activities impact Earth's systems? How can we mitigate natural hazards and live more sustainably?
*   **Unit 5: Interpreting Earth's History (Integrates concepts from ESS1 & ESS2)**
    *   Key Concepts: Geologic time scale, principles of relative dating (superposition, cross-cutting relationships), absolute dating (radiometric dating), fossils as evidence of past life and environments, landscape development.
    *   Learning Objectives: (e.g., HS-ESS1-5: Evaluate evidence of the past and current movements of continental and oceanic crust and the theory of plate tectonics to explain the ages of crustal rocks. HS-ESS1-6: Apply scientific reasoning and evidence from ancient Earth materials, meteorites, and other planetary surfaces to construct an account of Earth’s formation and early history.)
    *   Essential Questions: How do scientists determine the age of rocks and fossils? How has Earth's environment changed over geologic time?
*   ... (Units may include more specific regional geology or topics based on local curriculum needs within the NYSSLS framework)

## III. Instructional Strategies & Resources
*   **Key Pedagogical Approaches:** (e.g., UDL principles, inquiry-based laboratory investigations (often mandated by NYS for Regents eligibility), map reading and interpretation (topographic, geologic, weather maps), model building (e.g., stream tables, earthquake simulators), data analysis (weather data, seismic data, rock properties), fieldwork (if possible), use of Earth Science Reference Tables (ESRT - critical for NYS))
*   **Potential Interdisciplinary Connections:** (e.g., Chemistry of minerals (Chemistry), Physics of plate tectonics and weather systems (Physics), Mathematical modeling of Earth processes (Math), Human impact on environment (Environmental Science/Social Studies), Astronomy and space exploration (Physics/Technology))
*   **Ideas for Supplemental Materials & Technology Integration:** (Rock and mineral samples, fossils, topographic maps, globes, stream tables, weather instruments, seismographs (or simulations), ESRT, online databases (USGS, NOAA, NASA), GIS software (introductory), virtual field trips, documentaries on Earth science topics)

## IV. Assessment Strategies
*   **Formative Assessments:** (Lab reports (often with specific NYS requirements), map quizzes, ESRT-based exercises, exit tickets, concept maps, analysis of weather or geologic data, presentations of research)
*   **Summative Assessments:** (Unit exams with multiple-choice, short-answer, and constructed-response questions (often Regents-style), performance-based lab practicals, projects involving geological or meteorological analysis, final exam (Earth Science Regents Exam))
*   **Accommodations & Modifications (IDEA/504):** (Highlighted ESRT, pre-labeled diagrams for labs, simplified map reading tasks, vocabulary support, extended time for labs and tests, use of physical models to explain abstract concepts)
*   **ELL Support Strategies:** (Bilingual glossaries for Earth science terms, visual dictionaries for rocks, minerals, and landforms, extensive use of visuals and hands-on activities, sentence frames for lab reports and explanations, peer support in lab groups, connecting concepts to local geography or weather phenomena)
