# High School - Living Environment (Biology) - NYS Science Learning Standards (NYSSLS)

## I. Overview and Alignment
*   **Subject Description:** This course explores the fundamental concepts of biology, focusing on themes such as unity and diversity of life, genetics and heredity, evolution, ecology, and human physiology. Students engage in scientific inquiry, data analysis, and understanding the impact of biology on society. This course typically culminates in a Regents exam.
*   **NYS Learning Standards Addressed:** (Specific High School Life Science Performance Expectations (PEs) from NYSSLS, e.g., HS-LS1: From Molecules to Organisms: Structures and Processes; HS-LS2: Ecosystems: Interactions, Energy, and Dynamics; HS-LS3: Heredity: Inheritance and Variation of Traits; HS-LS4: Biological Evolution: Unity and Diversity. Also incorporates relevant Science and Engineering Practices and Crosscutting Concepts.)
*   **Federal Mandate Considerations (if applicable):** (e.g., ESSA's well-rounded education, IDEA considerations for UDL)
*   **Statutory Instructional Mandates Integrated (if applicable):** (e.g., Health education topics related to human physiology, disease prevention; humane treatment of animals if live specimens are used; environmental awareness)

## II. Core Concepts / Units (Aligned with NYSSLS High School Life Science PEs)
(Logically sequenced units or major topics)
*   **Unit 1: Organization of Life: From Molecules to Organisms (HS-LS1)**
    *   Key Concepts: Characteristics of life, biochemistry (carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, nucleic acids), cell structure and function (organelles, prokaryotic vs. eukaryotic), levels of organization (cells, tissues, organs, organ systems, organisms), homeostasis, human body systems (overview).
    *   Learning Objectives: (e.g., HS-LS1-1: Construct an explanation based on evidence for how the structure of DNA determines the structure of proteins which carry out the essential functions of life through systems of specialized cells. HS-LS1-2: Develop and use a model to illustrate the hierarchical organization of interacting systems that provide specific functions within multicellular organisms. HS-LS1-3: Plan and conduct an investigation to provide evidence that feedback mechanisms maintain homeostasis.)
    *   Essential Questions: What are the fundamental building blocks of living things? How are living organisms organized to carry out life functions? How do organisms maintain internal balance?
*   **Unit 2: Energy and Matter in Living Systems (HS-LS1, HS-LS2)**
    *   Key Concepts: Photosynthesis (inputs, outputs, importance), cellular respiration (aerobic and anaerobic, ATP production), cycling of matter (carbon, nitrogen cycles), flow of energy through ecosystems (food chains, food webs, trophic levels, energy pyramids).
    *   Learning Objectives: (e.g., HS-LS1-5: Use a model to illustrate how photosynthesis transforms light energy into stored chemical energy. HS-LS1-7: Use a model to illustrate that cellular respiration is a chemical process whereby the bonds of food molecules and oxygen molecules are broken and the bonds in new compounds are formed resulting in a net transfer of energy. HS-LS2-3: Construct and revise an explanation based on evidence for the cycling of matter and flow of energy in aerobic and anaerobic conditions.)
    *   Essential Questions: How do organisms obtain and use energy? How do matter and energy move through ecosystems?
*   **Unit 3: Heredity: Inheritance and Variation of Traits (HS-LS3)**
    *   Key Concepts: DNA structure and replication, protein synthesis (transcription, translation), Mendelian genetics (dominant/recessive alleles, Punnett squares, patterns of inheritance), meiosis, mutations, genetic engineering and biotechnology (basic concepts and societal implications).
    *   Learning Objectives: (e.g., HS-LS3-1: Ask questions to clarify relationships about the role of DNA and chromosomes in coding the instructions for characteristic traits passed from parents to offspring. HS-LS3-2: Make and defend a claim based on evidence that inheritable genetic variations may result from: (1) new genetic combinations through meiosis, (2) viable errors occurring during replication, and/or (3) mutations caused by environmental factors.)
    *   Essential Questions: How are traits passed from parents to offspring? How does DNA code for proteins and determine traits? What are the sources of genetic variation?
*   **Unit 4: Biological Evolution: Unity and Diversity (HS-LS4)**
    *   Key Concepts: Evidence for evolution (fossils, comparative anatomy, embryology, biochemistry), natural selection (variation, overproduction, competition, survival of the fittest), adaptation, speciation, classification systems (taxonomy, cladograms), origins of life (brief overview).
    *   Learning Objectives: (e.g., HS-LS4-1: Communicate scientific information that common ancestry and biological evolution are supported by multiple lines of empirical evidence. HS-LS4-2: Construct an explanation based on evidence that the process of evolution primarily results from four factors: (1) the potential for a species to increase in number, (2) the heritable genetic variation of individuals in a species due to mutation and sexual reproduction, (3) competition for limited resources, and (4) the proliferation of those organisms that are better able to survive and reproduce in the environment.)
    *   Essential Questions: How has life on Earth changed over time? What is the mechanism of evolution by natural selection? How does evolution explain the unity and diversity of life?
*   **Unit 5: Ecology: Interactions and Dynamics in Ecosystems (HS-LS2)**
    *   Key Concepts: Biotic and abiotic factors, population dynamics (growth, carrying capacity, limiting factors), community interactions (competition, predation, symbiosis), ecological succession, biodiversity, human impact on ecosystems (pollution, climate change, habitat destruction, conservation).
    *   Learning Objectives: (e.g., HS-LS2-1: Use mathematical and/or computational representations to support explanations of factors that affect carrying capacity of ecosystems at different scales. HS-LS2-6: Evaluate the claims, evidence, and reasoning that the complex interactions in ecosystems maintain relatively consistent numbers and types of organisms in stable conditions, but changing conditions may result in a new ecosystem. HS-LS2-7: Design, evaluate, and refine a solution for reducing the impacts of human activities on the environment and biodiversity.)
    *   Essential Questions: How do organisms interact with each other and their environment? How do ecosystems change over time? What is the impact of human activities on the biosphere, and how can we promote sustainability?
*   ... (Units may include more specific topics like human reproduction, disease, etc., as per local curriculum needs within the NYSSLS framework)

## III. Instructional Strategies & Resources
*   **Key Pedagogical Approaches:** (e.g., UDL principles, inquiry-based laboratory investigations (often mandated by NYS for Regents eligibility), model building, data analysis and interpretation, case studies, debates on bioethical issues, fieldwork (if possible), use of microscopes, dissections (virtual or actual, following ethical guidelines))
*   **Potential Interdisciplinary Connections:** (e.g., Biochemistry (Chemistry), Statistical analysis of biological data (Math/Statistics), Bioethics (Social Studies/Philosophy), Environmental policy (Social Studies/Civics), Health and disease (Health Education))
*   **Ideas for Supplemental Materials & Technology Integration:** (Microscopes, prepared slides, lab equipment for experiments (glassware, chemicals, sensors), models (DNA, cell, human torso), online simulations and virtual labs, databases for genetic information or ecological data, documentaries on biological topics, current science news articles)

## IV. Assessment Strategies
*   **Formative Assessments:** (Lab reports (often with specific NYS requirements), quizzes on vocabulary and concepts, exit tickets, concept maps, class discussions, analysis of scientific articles, presentations of research findings)
*   **Summative Assessments:** (Unit exams with multiple-choice, short-answer, and essay questions (often Regents-style), performance-based lab practicals, research projects on biological topics, presentations on bioethical issues, final exam (Living Environment Regents Exam))
*   **Accommodations & Modifications (IDEA/504):** (Visual aids for complex processes (e.g., protein synthesis, meiosis), pre-filled lab notes or outlines, simplified diagrams, use of word banks for vocabulary, extended time for labs and tests, alternative formats for demonstrating understanding (e.g., oral reports instead of written))
*   **ELL Support Strategies:** (Bilingual glossaries for biological terms, visual dictionaries, labeled diagrams, hands-on activities with clear demonstrations, sentence frames for writing lab conclusions or explanations, peer support in lab groups, connections to local flora/fauna or health issues relevant to students' backgrounds)
