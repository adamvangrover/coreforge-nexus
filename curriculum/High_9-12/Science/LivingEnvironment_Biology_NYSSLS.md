# High School - Living Environment (Biology) - NYS Science Learning Standards (NYSSLS)

## I. Overview and Alignment
*   **Subject Description:** The Living Environment course, typically taken in the first or second year of high school, is an introductory biology course designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental concepts and principles of life science. Students explore major themes including the unity and diversity of life, cell biology, genetics and heredity, evolution, ecological interactions, human physiology, and the impact of humans on the environment. A significant emphasis is placed on scientific inquiry, developing laboratory skills, analyzing data, and understanding the application of biological knowledge to real-world issues and societal concerns. This course culminates in the NYS Living Environment Regents Examination, which includes a laboratory practical component.
*   **NYS Learning Standards Addressed:** This course is aligned with the **New York State Science Learning Standards (NYSSLS)**, specifically the High School Life Science Performance Expectations (PEs). These are three-dimensional standards, integrating:
    *   **Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCIs):**
        *   **LS1: From Molecules to Organisms: Structures and Processes** (e.g., structure and function of cells, organization of life, growth and development, homeostasis, photosynthesis, cellular respiration)
        *   **LS2: Ecosystems: Interactions, Energy, and Dynamics** (e.g., interdependent relationships, cycles of matter and energy transfer, ecosystem dynamics, functioning, and resilience, social interactions and group behavior)
        *   **LS3: Heredity: Inheritance and Variation of Traits** (e.g., DNA structure, protein synthesis, inheritance patterns, meiosis, mutations, genetic variation)
        *   **LS4: Biological Evolution: Unity and Diversity** (e.g., evidence for evolution, natural selection, adaptation, speciation, biodiversity)
    *   **Science and Engineering Practices (SEPs):** (e.g., Asking Questions and Defining Problems; Developing and Using Models; Planning and Carrying Out Investigations; Analyzing and Interpreting Data; Using Mathematics and Computational Thinking; Constructing Explanations and Designing Solutions; Engaging in Argument from Evidence; Obtaining, Evaluating, and Communicating Information)
    *   **Crosscutting Concepts (CCCs):** (e.g., Patterns; Cause and Effect; Scale, Proportion, and Quantity; Systems and System Models; Energy and Matter; Structure and Function; Stability and Change)
    *   *Illustrative PEs include:* HS-LS1-1, HS-LS1-2, HS-LS1-3, HS-LS1-4, HS-LS1-5, HS-LS1-6, HS-LS1-7; HS-LS2-1, HS-LS2-2, HS-LS2-3, HS-LS2-4, HS-LS2-5, HS-LS2-6, HS-LS2-7, HS-LS2-8; HS-LS3-1, HS-LS3-2, HS-LS3-3; HS-LS4-1, HS-LS4-2, HS-LS4-3, HS-LS4-4, HS-LS4-5, HS-LS4-6.
*   **Federal Mandate Considerations (if applicable):**
    *   **ESSA (Every Student Succeeds Act):** Living Environment contributes to a "well-rounded education" by fostering scientific literacy, critical thinking, and inquiry skills essential for college and careers.
    *   **IDEA (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act):** Instruction will be guided by UDL principles. Accommodations, modifications, and assistive technologies (e.g., visual aids, scaffolded lab reports, adapted equipment) will be provided as per IEPs and 504 plans to ensure all students can access the curriculum and participate in lab activities.
*   **Statutory Instructional Mandates Integrated (if applicable):**
    *   **Health Education Topics:** Content related to human anatomy, physiology, disease (causes, prevention, immune response), nutrition, and substance abuse is often integrated within relevant LS1 topics.
    *   **Humane Treatment of Animals:** If live specimens are used in labs (e.g., daphnia, insects) or dissections are performed, instruction must align with NYS guidelines for humane treatment and ethical considerations. Virtual dissections are often encouraged.
    *   **Environmental Awareness and Conservation:** LS2 and LS4 topics naturally integrate instruction on environmental issues, biodiversity, conservation, and sustainable practices, aligning with NYS's emphasis on environmental education.
    *   **Laboratory Safety:** Explicit instruction on lab safety protocols, proper handling of chemicals and equipment, and emergency procedures is a critical and ongoing component.
