# High School - Chemistry (Physical Setting) - NYS Science Learning Standards (NYSSLS)

## I. Overview and Alignment
*   **Subject Description:** The Physical Setting/Chemistry course, typically taken after Living Environment and/or Earth Science, delves into the fundamental principles governing matter and its changes. Students explore atomic structure, the periodic table, chemical bonding, types of chemical reactions, stoichiometry (quantitative relationships in reactions), thermodynamics (energy changes), kinetics (reaction rates), chemical equilibrium, acid-base chemistry, redox reactions, and an introduction to organic chemistry. A strong emphasis is placed on developing problem-solving skills, quantitative reasoning, safe and effective laboratory techniques, and interpreting data, often utilizing the **NYS Chemistry Reference Tables (CRT)**. This course culminates in the NYS Physical Setting/Chemistry Regents Examination, which includes a laboratory practical component.
*   **NYS Learning Standards Addressed:** This course is aligned with the **New York State Science Learning Standards (NYSSLS)**, specifically the High School Physical Sciences Performance Expectations (PEs) relevant to chemistry. These are three-dimensional standards, integrating:
    *   **Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCIs):**
        *   **PS1: Matter and Its Interactions** (e.g., structure and properties of matter, chemical reactions, nuclear processes)
        *   **PS2: Motion and Stability: Forces and Interactions** (e.g., PS2.B types of interactions – focusing on intermolecular forces and bonding)
        *   **PS3: Energy** (e.g., PS3.A definitions of energy, PS3.B conservation of energy and energy transfer, PS3.D energy in chemical processes)
    *   **Science and Engineering Practices (SEPs):** (e.g., Asking Questions and Defining Problems; Developing and Using Models; Planning and Carrying Out Investigations; Analyzing and Interpreting Data; Using Mathematics and Computational Thinking; Constructing Explanations and Designing Solutions; Engaging in Argument from Evidence; Obtaining, Evaluating, and Communicating Information)
    *   **Crosscutting Concepts (CCCs):** (e.g., Patterns; Cause and Effect; Scale, Proportion, and Quantity; Systems and System Models; Energy and Matter; Structure and Function; Stability and Change)
    *   *Illustrative PEs include:* HS-PS1-1, HS-PS1-2, HS-PS1-3, HS-PS1-4, HS-PS1-5, HS-PS1-6, HS-PS1-7, HS-PS1-8; HS-PS2-6 (related to material properties); HS-PS3-1, HS-PS3-2, HS-PS3-4.
*   **Federal Mandate Considerations (if applicable):**
    *   **ESSA (Every Student Succeeds Act):** Chemistry contributes to a "well-rounded education" by fostering scientific literacy, analytical skills, and an understanding of the material world.
    *   **IDEA (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act):** Instruction will be guided by UDL principles. Accommodations, modifications, and assistive technologies (e.g., highlighted CRT, tactile models for molecular geometry, simplified lab procedures, software for data plotting) will be provided as per IEPs and 504 plans.
*   **Statutory Instructional Mandates Integrated (if applicable):**
    *   **Safe Handling of Chemicals and Laboratory Safety:** This is a paramount and ongoing instructional mandate, including proper use of safety equipment (goggles, aprons), understanding Safety Data Sheets (SDS), waste disposal, and emergency procedures.
    *   **Environmental Impact of Chemical Processes:** Discussions on pollution, green chemistry principles, and the impact of industrial chemistry are relevant.
    *   **Fire and Arson Prevention (Conceptual Links):** Understanding combustion reactions, flammability of substances, and energy release.
