# High School - Chemistry (Physical Setting) - NYS Science Learning Standards (NYSSLS)

## I. Overview and Alignment
*   **Subject Description:** This course explores the fundamental principles of chemistry, including the structure of matter, chemical bonding, reactions, stoichiometry, thermodynamics, kinetics, and equilibrium. Students develop skills in problem-solving, quantitative reasoning, and laboratory investigation. This course typically culminates in a Regents exam.
*   **NYS Learning Standards Addressed:** (Specific High School Physical Science Performance Expectations (PEs) from NYSSLS related to Chemistry, e.g., HS-PS1: Matter and Its Interactions; HS-PS2: Motion and Stability: Forces and Interactions (aspects related to intermolecular forces, bonding); HS-PS3: Energy (aspects related to chemical energy, enthalpy, entropy). Also incorporates relevant Science and Engineering Practices and Crosscutting Concepts.)
*   **Federal Mandate Considerations (if applicable):** (e.g., ESSA's well-rounded education, IDEA considerations for UDL)
*   **Statutory Instructional Mandates Integrated (if applicable):** (e.g., Safe handling of chemicals, environmental impact of chemical processes, potentially Fire and Arson Prevention if discussing combustion chemistry)

    *   Learning Objectives: (e.g., HS-PS1-1: Use the periodic table as a model to predict the relative properties of elements based on the patterns of electrons in the outermost energy level of atoms. HS-PS1-8: Develop models to illustrate the changes in the composition of the nucleus of the atom and the energy released during the processes of fission, fusion, and radioactive decay.)
    *   Essential Questions: What is the fundamental structure of an atom? How does the periodic table organize elements and predict their properties?
*   **Unit 2: Chemical Bonding and Intermolecular Forces (HS-PS1, HS-PS2)**
    *   Key Concepts: Types of chemical bonds (ionic, covalent, metallic), Lewis dot structures, VSEPR theory and molecular geometry, polarity, intermolecular forces (hydrogen bonding, dipole-dipole, London dispersion forces) and their effects on properties (boiling point, vapor pressure).
    *   Learning Objectives: (e.g., HS-PS1-2: Construct and revise an explanation for the outcome of a simple chemical reaction based on the outermost electron states of atoms, trends in the periodic table, and knowledge of the patterns of chemical properties. HS-PS2-6: Communicate scientific and technical information about why the molecular-level structure is important in the functioning of designed materials.)
    *   Essential Questions: How and why do atoms bond together to form compounds? How do the forces between molecules affect the properties of substances?
*   **Unit 3: Stoichiometry and Chemical Reactions (HS-PS1)**
    *   Key Concepts: The mole concept, molar mass, percent composition, empirical and molecular formulas, balancing chemical equations, types of chemical reactions (synthesis, decomposition, single/double replacement, combustion), stoichiometry calculations (mole ratios, limiting reactants, percent yield).
    *   Learning Objectives: (e.g., HS-PS1-7: Use mathematical representations to support the claim that atoms, and therefore mass, are conserved during a chemical reaction.)
    *   Essential Questions: How can we quantify amounts of substances in chemical reactions? How do balanced chemical equations represent the conservation of matter?
*   **Unit 4: Solutions and Aqueous Chemistry (HS-PS1)**
    *   Key Concepts: Properties of solutions (solute, solvent, concentration units like molarity), factors affecting solubility, colligative properties (briefly), acids, bases, and salts (properties, pH scale, neutralization reactions, titrations - introductory).
    *   Learning Objectives: (e.g., HS-PS1-3: Plan and conduct an investigation to gather evidence to compare the structure of substances at the bulk scale to infer the strength of electrical forces between particles. (Relates to dissociation in solutions))
    *   Essential Questions: What happens when substances dissolve? How do we describe and measure the acidity or basicity of solutions?
*   **Unit 5: Thermodynamics and Kinetics (HS-PS1, HS-PS3)**
    *   Key Concepts: Energy changes in chemical reactions (endothermic/exothermic), enthalpy (âˆ†H), Hess's Law (introductory), factors affecting reaction rates (temperature, concentration, surface area, catalysts), collision theory, activation energy.
    *   Learning Objectives: (e.g., HS-PS1-4: Develop a model to illustrate that the release or absorption of energy from a chemical reaction system depends upon the changes in total bond energy. HS-PS3-1: Create a computational model to calculate the change in the energy of one component in a system when the change in energy of the other component(s) and energy flows in and out of the system are known.)
    *   Essential Questions: Why do chemical reactions release or absorb energy? What factors control how fast a chemical reaction occurs?
*   **Unit 6: Chemical Equilibrium and Redox (HS-PS1)**
    *   Key Concepts: Concept of dynamic equilibrium, Le Chatelier's Principle, equilibrium constants (Keq - conceptual), oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions, assigning oxidation numbers, electrochemical cells (voltaic/galvanic cells - introductory).
    *   Learning Objectives: (e.g., HS-PS1-5: Apply scientific principles and evidence to provide an explanation about the effects of changing the temperature or concentration of the reacting particles on the rate at which a reaction occurs. HS-PS1-6: Refine the design of a chemical system by specifying a change in conditions that would produce increased amounts of products at equilibrium.)
    *   Essential Questions: What does it mean for a chemical system to be at equilibrium? How can we predict and control the direction of reversible reactions? What are oxidation and reduction, and how are they applied in electrochemistry?
*   **Unit 7: Organic Chemistry (Introductory)**
    *   Key Concepts: Properties of carbon, hydrocarbons (alkanes, alkenes, alkynes), functional groups (alcohols, ethers, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, esters, amines, amides - basic identification and naming), simple organic reactions (e.g., combustion, substitution, addition - very basic).
    *   Learning Objectives: (Students will be able to name and draw simple organic compounds and identify common functional groups.)
    *   Essential Questions: What makes carbon unique and able to form such a vast array of compounds? What are the basic families of organic compounds?

## III. Instructional Strategies & Resources
*   **Key Pedagogical Approaches:** (e.g., UDL principles, inquiry-based laboratory investigations (often mandated by NYS for Regents eligibility), demonstrations, model building (molecular models), problem-solving sessions, data analysis, use of Chemistry Reference Tables (CRT - critical for NYS))
*   **Potential Interdisciplinary Connections:** (e.g., Biochemistry (Biology), Materials science (Physics/Engineering), Environmental chemistry (Environmental Science), Stoichiometry in industrial processes (Technology/Engineering))
*   **Ideas for Supplemental Materials & Technology Integration:** (Lab equipment (glassware, balances, burners, titration apparatus, spectrophotometers - if available), molecular modeling kits, periodic tables, Chemistry Reference Tables, online simulations of chemical reactions and molecular structures, data collection probes (pH, temperature), chemical databases)

## IV. Assessment Strategies
*   **Formative Assessments:** (Lab reports (often with specific NYS requirements), homework problem sets, quizzes on nomenclature and concepts, exit tickets, analysis of experimental data, presentations on chemical topics)
*   **Summative Assessments:** (Unit exams with multiple-choice, problem-solving, and constructed-response questions (often Regents-style), performance-based lab practicals, projects involving chemical analysis or research, final exam (Chemistry Regents Exam))
*   **Accommodations & Modifications (IDEA/504):** (Highlighted CRT, pre-labeled diagrams for lab setups, step-by-step guides for stoichiometric calculations, vocabulary support, extended time for labs and tests, use of physical models to explain abstract concepts like VSEPR)
*   **ELL Support Strategies:** (Bilingual glossaries for chemical terms, visual dictionaries for lab equipment and molecular shapes, extensive use of visuals and hands-on activities, sentence frames for lab reports and explanations, peer support in lab groups, connecting chemical concepts to everyday materials and phenomena)
