# Demonstration 01: Relative Velocity Vectors

## Purpose
To visually demonstrate how velocity vectors add together, specifically in the context of relative motion. This helps students understand why "5 m/s + 5 m/s" doesn't always equal "10 m/s".

## Materials
*   Battery-operated toy car or bulldozer (constant speed).
*   A large sheet of paper or a movable board/plank (longer than the table width).
*   Markers.
*   Stopwatch.

## Procedure

### Scenario 1: The "Moving Sidewalk" (1D Addition)
1.  **Setup:** Place the movable board on the table.
2.  **Action A:** Turn the car on and let it drive across the stationary board. Measure the time it takes to cross. Calculate $v_{car}$.
3.  **Action B:** Pull the board across the table at a constant speed *without* the car. Measure time and calculate $v_{board}$.
4.  **Action C:** Place the car on the board. Turn it on. Pull the board in the **same** direction as the car.
    *   **Ask:** "Will the car appear to move faster or slower relative to the table (the class)?"
    *   **Observe:** The car zips across.
    *   **Math:** $v_{total} = v_{car} + v_{board}$.
5.  **Action D:** Pull the board in the **opposite** direction.
    *   **Math:** $v_{total} = v_{car} - v_{board}$.

### Scenario 2: The "River Crossing" (2D Vectors)
1.  **Setup:** Now pull the board *perpendicular* to the car's motion (like a boat crossing a river with a current).
2.  **Prediction:** Ask students to predict where the car will land on the other side. directly across? or downstream?
3.  **Action:** Drive the car across while pulling the board sideways.
4.  **Observe:** The car travels diagonally.
5.  **Analysis:** Draw the vector diagram on the board.
    *   $\vec{v}_{car}$ (North)
    *   $\vec{v}_{board}$ (East)
    *   $\vec{v}_{resultant}$ (North-East)
    *   Show that the time to cross is *independent* of the sideways pull (vertical component vs horizontal component).

## Discussion Questions
*   "If you are in a plane flying 500 mph, and you walk forward at 3 mph, how fast are you moving relative to the ground?"
*   "Why do pilots need to correct for wind when flying?"

## Safety Notes
*   Catch the car before it falls off the table!
