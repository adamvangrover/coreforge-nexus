# Experiment 01: Motion Graphing

## Introduction
Graphs are powerful tools for visualizing motion. In this lab, you will become the object in motion! Using a motion detector, you will attempt to replicate specific position-time and velocity-time graphs by walking back and forth.

## Learning Objectives
*   Relate physical motion (walking) to graphical representation.
*   Understand the relationship between slope and velocity on a position-time graph.
*   Understand the meaning of positive and negative velocity.

## Materials
*   Computer with data collection software (e.g., Logger Pro, Capstone).
*   Motion Detector (Ultrasonic sensor).
*   Meter stick.
*   Masking tape.

## Safety Precautions
*   Ensure the walking path is clear of obstacles.
*   Do not walk too fast or run.

## Procedure

### Part 1: Position vs. Time

1.  **Setup:** Connect the motion detector to the computer. Place the detector on a table facing an open area. Mark the floor with tape at 1m, 2m, and 3m from the detector.
2.  **Prediction:** Sketch a graph of a person walking *slowly* away from the detector at a constant speed.
3.  **Trial 1:** Start data collection. Stand at the 1m mark. Walk slowly away to the 3m mark. Stop.
4.  **Analysis:** Compare your prediction to the real graph.
    *   What does the slope represent? (Answer: Velocity).
    *   Was the slope constant?
5.  **Challenge:** The software will display a "Target Graph" (e.g., a "W" shape). Your goal is to walk in such a way that your motion matches the target graph.
    *   Sketch the target graph.
    *   Describe the motion required (e.g., "Start at 1m, stand still for 2s, walk fast away...").
    *   Perform the walk and record the "Match Score".

### Part 2: Velocity vs. Time

1.  **Setup:** Switch the graph display to Velocity vs. Time.
2.  **Prediction:** Sketch a graph of a person walking *away* at a constant speed, then *stopping*, then walking *towards* the detector at a faster speed.
3.  **Trial 2:** Perform the motion.
4.  **Analysis:**
    *   What does the "zero" line represent? (Rest).
    *   What is the difference between positive and negative velocity values? (Direction).
5.  **Challenge:** Match a "Target Velocity Graph" provided by the instructor.

## Analysis Questions
1.  On a position-time graph, what does a horizontal line indicate?
2.  On a velocity-time graph, what does a horizontal line (not at zero) indicate?
3.  Which is harder to match: Position or Velocity graphs? Why?
4.  Calculate your average velocity for Trial 1 using the slope formula ($m = \frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$).

## Conclusion
Write a paragraph summarizing how different types of motion (rest, constant velocity, changing direction) appear on both position-time and velocity-time graphs.
