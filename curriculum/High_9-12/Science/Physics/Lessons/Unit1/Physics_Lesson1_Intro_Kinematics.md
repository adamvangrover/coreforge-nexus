# Physics Lesson 1: Introduction to Kinematics

## Lesson Overview
In this introductory lesson, students will define the fundamental concepts of kinematics: position, distance, and displacement. They will explore the difference between the path length traveled and the change in position.

## Learning Objectives
*   Define **kinematics** as the study of motion without regarding its causes.
*   Distinguish between **distance** (scalar) and **displacement** (vector).
*   Calculate distance and displacement for 1D motion.

## Standards Alignment
*   **NYSSLS HS-PS2-1** (Foundational for describing motion).

## Materials Needed
*   Meter sticks.
*   Masking tape (to mark positions on the floor).
*   Student notebooks.

## Lesson Procedure

### 1. Warm-up / Bell Ringer (5 min)
*   **Prompt:** "If you walk 10 meters East, and then 5 meters West, how far have you walked? How far are you from where you started?"
*   Discuss student answers. Introduce the idea that "how far walked" and "where you are" are different.

### 2. Direct Instruction (15 min)
*   **Definitions:**
    *   **Position ($x$):** Location relative to an origin.
    *   **Distance ($d$):** Total length of path traveled. Always positive. (Scalar)
    *   **Displacement ($\Delta x$):** Change in position. Final position - Initial position ($\Delta x = x_f - x_i$). Has direction. (Vector)
*   **Example on board:** A number line. Move from 0 to +5, then to -2.
    *   Path: $0 \to 5$ (dist 5), $5 \to -2$ (dist 7). Total Distance = 12.
    *   Displacement: $x_f (-2) - x_i (0) = -2$.

### 3. Guided Practice (10 min)
*   Students work in pairs to solve 3 scenarios:
    1.  Runner on a circular track (400m circumference). One full lap. (Distance = 400m, Displacement = 0).
    2.  Elevator goes up 10 floors, down 3.
    3.  Ant walks on a ruler.

### 4. Activity: The Displacement Walk (10 min)
*   Mark a "0" point on the floor.
*   Have a student volunteer follow instructions: "Walk +3 meters, then -1 meter."
*   Class calculates distance vs displacement.

### 5. Assessment & Wrap-up (5 min)
*   **Exit Ticket:** "A car travels 50 km North and then 30 km South. What is the total distance? What is the displacement?"
