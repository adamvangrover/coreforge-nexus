# Physics Lesson 2: Scalars and Vectors

## Lesson Overview
Building on the concepts of distance and displacement, this lesson formalizes the distinction between scalar and vector quantities. This distinction is crucial for all of physics.

## Learning Objectives
*   Define **scalar** and **vector** quantities.
*   Categorize common physical quantities (mass, time, speed, velocity, force) as scalars or vectors.
*   Represent vectors graphically using arrows.

## Standards Alignment
*   **NYSSLS HS-PS2-1** (Mathematical representations of motion).

## Materials Needed
*   Whiteboard/Smartboard.
*   Vector arrows (cut out of paper or magnetic).

## Lesson Procedure

### 1. Warm-up (5 min)
*   Review Exit Ticket from Lesson 1.
*   Ask: "Does time have a direction? Does temperature have a direction?"

### 2. Direct Instruction (15 min)
*   **Scalars:** Quantities described by **magnitude** (size) only.
    *   Examples: Time, Mass, Distance, Speed, Temperature, Energy.
*   **Vectors:** Quantities described by **magnitude** AND **direction**.
    *   Examples: Displacement, Velocity, Acceleration, Force, Momentum.
*   **Notation:** Vectors often written with an arrow ($\vec{v}$) or bold ($v$).
*   **Graphical Representation:** Arrow length = magnitude. Arrow tip = direction.

### 3. Guided Practice (10 min)
*   **Sorting Activity:** List quantities on the board. Students classify them as Scalar or Vector.
    *   "50 miles per hour" (Speed - Scalar)
    *   "50 miles per hour North" (Velocity - Vector)
    *   "10 kilograms" (Mass - Scalar)
    *   "Pushing down with 10 Newtons" (Force - Vector)

### 4. Independent Practice (10 min)
*   Worksheet: "Scalar or Vector?".
*   Drawing vectors: "Draw a vector representing a velocity of 5 m/s East and another for 10 m/s North." (Check for relative lengths).

### 5. Assessment & Wrap-up (5 min)
*   **Think-Pair-Share:** Why is it dangerous to confuse speed (scalar) with velocity (vector) when navigating an airplane? (Answer: Speed tells you how fast, but not where you are going!)
