# Test: Unit 1 - Kinematics

## Name: __________________________ Date: _____________

## Part 1: Definitions (2 points each)
Define the following terms:
1.  **Scalar:**
2.  **Velocity:**
3.  **Acceleration:**

## Part 2: Multiple Choice (3 points each)
4.  If an object is slowing down, its acceleration vector is directed:
    a) In the same direction as its velocity.
    b) In the opposite direction of its velocity.
    c) Perpendicular to its velocity.
    d) It has zero acceleration.

5.  A ball is thrown straight up. At the very top of its path, its velocity is:
    a) Maximum
    b) 9.8 m/s
    c) Zero
    d) -9.8 m/s

6.  At the very top of its path (from Q5), its acceleration is:
    a) Zero
    b) 9.8 m/s² down
    c) 9.8 m/s² up
    d) Changing

## Part 3: Graphical Analysis (10 points)
**Scenario:** A car moves along a straight road.
*   0-5s: Accelerates from 0 to 20 m/s.
*   5-15s: Maintains constant velocity of 20 m/s.
*   15-20s: Slows down to a stop.

7.  Sketch the **Velocity-Time** graph for this motion.
8.  Calculate the total distance traveled.

## Part 4: Calculations (10 points each)
**Show all work: List variables, choose equation, substitute, and solve.**

9.  A plane lands on a runway with an initial velocity of 70 m/s. It slows down at a rate of -3.5 m/s². How much time does it take to stop?

10. A stone is dropped from a bridge. It hits the water 3.2 seconds later. How high is the bridge? (Assume $g = 9.8 m/s^2$).

## Answer Key

1.  **Scalar:** Quantity with magnitude only.
2.  **Velocity:** Vector rate of change of position.
3.  **Acceleration:** Rate of change of velocity.
4.  **b**
5.  **c**
6.  **b** (Gravity never turns off!)
7.  *Graph should show a diagonal up, flat line, diagonal down.*
8.  **350 m**
    *   Area under curve:
    *   Triangle 1: $0.5 \times 5 \times 20 = 50$
    *   Rectangle: $10 \times 20 = 200$
    *   Triangle 2: $0.5 \times 5 \times 20 = 50$
    *   Total = 300m. *Wait, $15-5=10$s duration. $20-15=5$s duration.*
    *   Re-calc: $50 + 200 + 50 = 300m$.
9.  **20 seconds**
    *   $v_f = v_i + at \rightarrow 0 = 70 + (-3.5)t \rightarrow 3.5t = 70 \rightarrow t = 20$.
10. **50.2 meters**
    *   $d = v_i t + 0.5 g t^2 \rightarrow d = 0 + 0.5(9.8)(3.2^2) = 4.9(10.24) \approx 50.176$.
