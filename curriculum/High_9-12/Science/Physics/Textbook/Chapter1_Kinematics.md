# Chapter 1: Kinematics - The Study of Motion

## 1.1 The Nature of Motion
Everything in the universe is in motion. From the electrons orbiting an atom to the galaxies rushing apart, motion is the rule, not the exception. **Kinematics** is the branch of mechanics that describes motion without referring to the forces that cause it.

### Frame of Reference
To describe motion, we must first establish a **frame of reference**. A frame of reference is a coordinate system used to define position. Usually, we choose the ground or a lab bench as our stationary frame ($x=0$).

## 1.2 Distance and Displacement
While often used interchangeably in everyday language, **distance** and **displacement** have distinct meanings in physics.

*   **Distance ($d$):** The total length of the path traveled between two positions. It is a scalar quantity (no direction).
*   **Displacement ($\Delta x$):** The change in position of an object. It is a vector quantity (has direction).
    $$ \Delta x = x_f - x_i $$
    Where $x_f$ is final position and $x_i$ is initial position.

**Example:**
Imagine a runner on a 400m circular track. If they run exactly one lap:
*   **Distance:** 400 meters.
*   **Displacement:** 0 meters (they ended where they started).

## 1.3 Speed and Velocity
Just as distance and displacement differ, so do speed and velocity.

*   **Average Speed:** Total distance divided by total time. (Scalar)
    $$ \text{Speed}_{avg} = \frac{d}{t} $$
*   **Average Velocity ($\bar{v}$):** Displacement divided by time. (Vector)
    $$ \bar{v} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} $$

**Key Point:** Velocity includes direction (e.g., "+20 m/s" or "20 m/s East"). Speed is just the magnitude ("20 m/s").

## 1.4 Acceleration
**Acceleration ($a$)** is the rate at which velocity changes. Since velocity is a vector, acceleration describes changes in speed, direction, or both.

$$ \bar{a} = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{v_f - v_i}{t_f - t_i} $$

*   If velocity and acceleration are in the **same** direction, the object **speeds up**.
*   If velocity and acceleration are in **opposite** directions, the object **slows down**.

## 1.5 The Kinematic Equations
For motion with **constant acceleration** in one dimension, we can use four powerful equations to predict the future state of an object.

1.  **Velocity-Time:**
    $$ v_f = v_i + a t $$
2.  **Position-Time:**
    $$ \Delta x = v_i t + \frac{1}{2} a t^2 $$
3.  **Velocity-Position:**
    $$ v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2 a \Delta x $$
4.  **Average Velocity:**
    $$ \Delta x = \frac{1}{2}(v_i + v_f) t $$

## 1.6 Graphical Analysis
Graphs provide a visual story of motion.

*   **Position-Time (x-t) Graph:**
    *   Slope = Velocity.
    *   Curved line = Acceleration.
*   **Velocity-Time (v-t) Graph:**
    *   Slope = Acceleration.
    *   Area under curve = Displacement.

## Chapter Summary
*   **Scalars** have magnitude only; **Vectors** have magnitude and direction.
*   **Displacement** is change in position.
*   **Velocity** is the rate of change of position.
*   **Acceleration** is the rate of change of velocity.
*   **Kinematic Equations** link displacement, velocity, acceleration, and time.
