# Unit 1: Kinematics - Describing Motion

## Unit Overview
This unit introduces students to the language of motion. We will move from qualitative descriptions to precise mathematical definitions of position, displacement, speed, velocity, and acceleration. Students will learn to represent motion using words, diagrams, numbers, graphs, and equations. This unit lays the foundation for all future study of mechanics.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this unit, students will be able to:
1.  **Differentiate** between scalar and vector quantities (distance vs. displacement, speed vs. velocity).
2.  **Calculate** average speed, average velocity, and acceleration.
3.  **Apply** the four kinematic equations to solve problems involving constant acceleration in one dimension.
4.  **Interpret and Construct** position-time, velocity-time, and acceleration-time graphs.
5.  **Analyze** free-fall motion as a special case of constant acceleration.

## Standards Alignment (NYSSLS)
*   **HS-PS2-1:** Analyze data to support the claim that Newton’s second law of motion describes the mathematical relationship among the net force on a macroscopic object, its mass, and its acceleration. (Foundational)
*   **HS-PS4-1:** Use mathematical representations to support a claim regarding relationships among the frequency, wavelength, and speed of waves traveling in various media. (Foundational skill: v=d/t)

## Essential Questions
*   How do we describe where an object is and how it is moving?
*   What is the difference between "how fast" and "how fast in a specific direction"?
*   How can graphs tell the story of an object's motion?

## Key Vocabulary
*   Frame of Reference
*   Scalar / Vector
*   Displacement
*   Velocity
*   Acceleration
*   Instantaneous vs. Average
*   Free Fall

## Materials Needed
*   Motion detectors/sensors (e.g., Vernier GoMotion or Pasco)
*   Carts and tracks
*   Meter sticks and stopwatches
*   Graphing software or graph paper

## Instructional Sequence (Summary)
1.  **Introduction to Measurement & 1D Motion:** Position, Distance, Displacement.
2.  **Speed vs. Velocity:** The importance of direction.
3.  **Graphing Motion (Part 1):** Position-time graphs. slope = velocity.
4.  **Acceleration:** Definition and conceptual understanding.
5.  **Graphing Motion (Part 2):** Velocity-time graphs. slope = acceleration, area = displacement.
6.  **Kinematic Equations:** Derivation and problem solving.
7.  **Free Fall:** Gravity as acceleration.

## Assessment Strategies
*   **Formative:** Whiteboard graphing challenges, "Motion Match" lab activity.
*   **Summative:** [Quiz_Unit1_Kinematics](../Quizzes/Quiz_Unit1_Kinematics.md), [Test_Unit1_Kinematics](../Tests/Test_Unit1_Kinematics.md).
