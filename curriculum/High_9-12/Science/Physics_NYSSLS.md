# High School - Physics - NYS Science Learning Standards (NYSSLS)

## I. Overview and Alignment
*   **Subject Description:** Physics is a laboratory-based science course that explores the fundamental principles governing energy, matter, motion, and forces. Students will investigate concepts in classical mechanics, thermodynamics, waves, optics, electricity, magnetism, and modern physics. Emphasis is placed on developing problem-solving skills, quantitative reasoning, and understanding the application of physics principles in the real world and technological advancements.
*   **NYS Learning Standards Addressed:**
    *   **HS-PS2-1:** Analyze data to support the claim that Newton’s second law of motion describes the mathematical relationship among the net force on a macroscopic object, its mass, and its acceleration.
    *   **HS-PS2-2:** Use mathematical representations to support the claim that the total momentum of a system of objects is conserved when there is no net force on the system.
    *   **HS-PS3-1:** Create a computational model to calculate the change in the energy of one component in a system when the change in energy of the other component(s) and energy flows in and out of the system are known.
    *   **HS-PS3-2:** Develop and use models to illustrate that energy at the macroscopic scale can be accounted for as a combination of energy associated with the motions of particles (objects) and energy associated with the relative position of particles (objects).
    *   **HS-PS4-1:** Use mathematical representations to support a claim regarding relationships among the frequency, wavelength, and speed of waves traveling in various media.
    *   **HS-PS4-3:** Evaluate the claims, evidence, and reasoning behind the idea that electromagnetic radiation can be described either by a wave model or a particle model, and that for some situations one model is more useful than the other.
*   **Federal Mandate Considerations:** ESSA's emphasis on STEM education and well-rounded curriculum. IDEA principles for UDL.
*   **Statutory Instructional Mandates Integrated:** NYS Commissioner’s Regulations Part 100.5 (Diploma Requirements) - Physical Setting/Physics Core Curriculum.
