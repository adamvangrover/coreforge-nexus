# High School - Economics (Grade 12) - NYS K-12 Social Studies Framework (0.5 Credit)

## I. Overview and Alignment
*   **Subject Description:** This half-credit Grade 12 Economics course introduces students to fundamental economic concepts, the principles of microeconomics (how individuals and businesses make decisions) and macroeconomics (how the broader economy functions), the basics of personal finance, and the workings of the U.S. and global economies. A key emphasis is placed on developing economic reasoning skills, understanding the impact of economic choices, and preparing students for informed decision-making as consumers, producers, savers, investors, and citizens. This course is typically offered as a one-semester elective.
*   **NYS Learning Standards Addressed:**
    *   This course aligns primarily with the **NYS K-12 Social Studies Framework, Standard 4: Economics**. Key Ideas explored include:
        *   **12.E1: Scarcity and Choice:** Understanding fundamental economic problems, opportunity costs, and decision-making.
        *   **12.E2: Economic Systems:** Comparing how different societies (market, command, mixed, traditional) organize production, distribution, and consumption.
        *   **12.E3: Supply and Demand:** Analyzing how these forces interact to determine prices and allocate resources in markets.
        *   **12.E4: Market Structures:** Examining different types of competition (perfect competition, monopoly, oligopoly, monopolistic competition) and their effects.
        *   **12.E5: Labor and Business:** Understanding the roles of labor, entrepreneurship, and different business organizations.
        *   **12.E6: Money, Banking, and Finance:** Exploring the functions of money, the role of financial institutions, and basic investment concepts.
        *   **12.E7: National Economic Performance:** Measuring and analyzing indicators like GDP, inflation, and unemployment.
        *   **12.E8: Role of Government in the Economy:** Examining fiscal and monetary policies and regulatory functions.
        *   **12.E9: International Economics:** Understanding trade, specialization, exchange rates, and globalization.
        *   **12.E10: Personal Finance:** Applying economic principles to personal budgeting, saving, investing, credit, and risk management.
    *   It also integrates **NYS Social Studies Practices**, such as: Gathering, Using, and Interpreting Economic Data; Economic Reasoning and Decision-Making; Comparison and Contextualization of Economic Systems; and Civic Participation (through understanding public economic policy).
*   **Federal Mandate Considerations (if applicable):**
    *   **ESSA (Every Student Succeeds Act):** This course contributes to a "well-rounded education" by fostering economic literacy, a critical skill for college and career readiness.
    *   **IDEA (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act):** Instruction will utilize UDL principles. Accommodations and modifications will be provided as per IEPs and 504 plans to ensure all students can access economic concepts and participate in financial literacy activities.
*   **Statutory Instructional Mandates Integrated (if applicable):**
    *   **Civility, Citizenship, and Character Education:** Discussions around ethical economic behavior, income inequality, corporate social responsibility, and the impact of economic policies on different groups foster these values. Understanding economic systems is crucial for informed citizenship.
    *   **Financial Literacy:** While not a standalone mandate in the same way as some others, the course content directly addresses the growing need for financial literacy education.
