# High School - Economics (Grade 12) - NYS K-12 Social Studies Framework (0.5 Credit)

## I. Overview and Alignment
*   **Subject Description:** Introduction to fundamental economic concepts, principles of microeconomics and macroeconomics, personal finance, and the U.S. and global economies. Emphasis on economic reasoning and decision-making. (Typically a one-semester course).
*   **NYS Learning Standards Addressed:** (Primarily draws from NYS Social Studies Standard 4: Economics. Key Ideas related to Scarcity, Supply and Demand, Market Structures, Role of Government, Money and Banking, National Economic Performance (GDP, inflation, unemployment), International Trade, Personal Finance. Plus relevant Social Studies Practices.)
*   **Federal Mandate Considerations (if applicable):** (e.g., ESSA's well-rounded education, IDEA considerations for UDL)
*   **Statutory Instructional Mandates Integrated (if applicable):** (e.g., Civility, Character Education through discussions of ethical economic behavior, understanding of economic systems and policies for informed Citizenship)

## II. Core Concepts / Units
(Logically sequenced units or major topics)
*   **Unit 1: Foundations of Economics: Scarcity, Choice, and Systems**
    *   Key Concepts: Scarcity, opportunity cost, factors of production, basic economic questions (what, how, for whom to produce), types of economic systems (traditional, command, market, mixed), circular flow model.
    *   Learning Objectives: Students will explain the concept of scarcity and its impact on decision-making; compare and contrast different economic systems.
    *   Essential Questions: Why can't we have everything we want? How do different societies organize their economies to deal with scarcity?
*   **Unit 2: Microeconomics: Supply, Demand, and Market Dynamics**
    *   Key Concepts: Law of demand, law of supply, market equilibrium (price and quantity), determinants of supply and demand, elasticity, market structures (perfect competition, monopoly, oligopoly, monopolistic competition), role of prices.
    *   Learning Objectives: Students will analyze how supply and demand interact to determine market prices and quantities; evaluate the impact of different market structures on consumers and producers.
    *   Essential Questions: How are prices determined in a market economy? How does competition affect markets?
*   **Unit 3: Macroeconomics: Measuring National Economic Performance**
    *   Key Concepts: Gross Domestic Product (GDP), inflation (CPI), unemployment, business cycles, aggregate supply and demand (introductory), role of government (fiscal policy: taxes and spending; monetary policy: Federal Reserve, interest rates).
    *   Learning Objectives: Students will identify and explain key indicators of national economic performance; analyze the tools governments use to influence the macroeconomy.
    *   Essential Questions: How do we measure the health of an economy? What role does the government play in managing the economy?
*   **Unit 4: The Global Economy and International Trade**
    *   Key Concepts: Reasons for international trade, specialization, comparative advantage, trade barriers (tariffs, quotas, embargoes), arguments for and against free trade, exchange rates, globalization.
    *   Learning Objectives: Students will explain the benefits and costs of international trade; analyze the impact of globalization on national economies.
    *   Essential Questions: Why do countries trade with each other? How does international trade affect our economy and daily lives?
*   **Unit 5: Personal Finance: Making Informed Economic Decisions**
    *   Key Concepts: Budgeting, saving, investing (stocks, bonds, mutual funds - introductory), credit and debt, insurance, financial planning, consumer rights and responsibilities, impact of economic trends on personal finance.
    *   Learning Objectives: Students will apply economic principles to personal financial decision-making; develop strategies for responsible budgeting, saving, and investing.
    *   Essential Questions: How can I make smart choices with my money? How can understanding economics help me plan for my financial future?
*   ...

## III. Instructional Strategies & Resources
*   **Key Pedagogical Approaches:** (e.g., UDL principles, case studies of businesses and economic events, simulations (stock market games, budgeting activities), analysis of economic data and graphs, debates on economic policy issues, guest speakers (entrepreneurs, financial advisors), current events analysis (economic news))
*   **Potential Interdisciplinary Connections:** (e.g., Analyzing historical economic trends (Social Studies), Using mathematical models in economics (Math), Researching economic impacts of scientific innovations (Science), Writing reports on economic issues (ELA))
*   **Ideas for Supplemental Materials & Technology Integration:** (Economic news sources (Wall Street Journal, The Economist, Bloomberg), government agency websites (Bureau of Labor Statistics, Federal Reserve), online stock market simulators, personal finance websites and apps, videos explaining economic concepts (e.g., Khan Academy, Crash Course Economics), economic data visualization tools)

## IV. Assessment Strategies
*   **Formative Assessments:** (Quizzes on economic vocabulary and concepts, problem sets involving supply/demand graphs or GDP calculation, participation in economic simulations, analysis of current economic articles, exit tickets)
*   **Summative Assessments:** (Unit exams with multiple-choice and short-answer questions applying economic principles, research projects on specific industries or economic policies, presentations analyzing economic issues, personal finance plans or budgets, debates on economic policy with position papers)
*   **Accommodations & Modifications (IDEA/504):** (Access to calculators, formula sheets for economic calculations, graphic organizers for analyzing economic models (e.g., circular flow, supply/demand), simplified economic articles or case studies, visual aids for abstract concepts, extended time)
*   **ELL Support Strategies:** (Bilingual glossaries for economic terms, visual representations of economic concepts (graphs, charts with clear labels), sentence frames for discussing economic analysis, real-world examples relevant to students' experiences, peer collaboration for simulations and projects)
