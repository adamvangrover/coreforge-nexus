## IV. Assessment Strategies
*   **Formative Assessments:** (Practice Regents multiple-choice questions and essays, quizzes, document analysis activities, participation in debates, outlines for essays, peer review of written work)
*   **Summative Assessments:** (Full-length DBQ essays, thematic essays (often mirroring Regents format), research papers or presentations on modern global issues, unit exams, mock Regents exams)
*   **Accommodations & Modifications (IDEA/504):** (Scaffolding for DBQ and thematic essay writing, vocabulary support for complex historical terms, graphic organizers for comparing events or ideologies, access to condensed notes or summaries, extended time, use of highlighters for document analysis)
