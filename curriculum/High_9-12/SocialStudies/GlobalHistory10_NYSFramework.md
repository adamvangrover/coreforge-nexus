*   **Ideas for Supplemental Materials & Technology Integration:** (Primary source documents (treaties, speeches, diaries, photographs), news articles (historical and current), documentaries, online databases of global statistics, interactive maps, virtual field trips to historical sites, Regents review materials)

## IV. Assessment Strategies
*   **Formative Assessments:** (Practice Regents multiple-choice questions and essays, quizzes, document analysis activities, participation in debates, outlines for essays, peer review of written work)
*   **Summative Assessments:** (Full-length DBQ essays, thematic essays (often mirroring Regents format), research papers or presentations on modern global issues, unit exams, mock Regents exams)
*   **Accommodations & Modifications (IDEA/504):** (Scaffolding for DBQ and thematic essay writing, vocabulary support for complex historical terms, graphic organizers for comparing events or ideologies, access to condensed notes or summaries, extended time, use of highlighters for document analysis)
*   **ELL Support Strategies:** (Bilingual glossaries, visual aids for abstract concepts (e.g., Cold War alliances), sentence frames for constructing historical arguments, explicit instruction in essay structure, small group work for document analysis and discussion, culturally relevant examples where possible)
