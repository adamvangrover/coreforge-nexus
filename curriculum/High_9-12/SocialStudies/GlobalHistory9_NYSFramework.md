# High School - Global History and Geography I (Grade 9) - NYS K-12 Social Studies Framework
**Note: The content herein is a proposed draft for Subject Matter Expert (SME) review and expansion.**

## I. Overview and Alignment
*   **Subject Description:** Global History and Geography I is the first year of a two-year sequence exploring world history. This course typically covers human history from the Paleolithic Era through the early modern period (approximately 1750 CE). Key themes include the development of early civilizations, the rise and fall of classical empires, the growth of major belief systems, expanding interregional networks of exchange, and the transformative impact of the Renaissance, Reformation, Scientific Revolution, and early European global exploration. Geographic influences on historical developments are a consistent focus.
*   **NYS Learning Standards Addressed:** (Key Ideas and Conceptual Understandings from the NYS K-12 Social Studies Framework for Grade 9 Global History & Geography. Illustrative examples:)
    *   **9.1 THE NEOLITHIC REVOLUTION AND EARLY CIVILIZATIONS:** (e.g., 9.1a The Neolithic Revolution was a turning point... 9.1b Complex societies and civilizations developed in many parts of the world...)
    *   **9.2 CLASSICAL CIVILIZATIONS:** (e.g., 9.2a Classical civilizations (Greece, Rome, Han China, Gupta India) established institutions, systems of governance, and cultural achievements... 9.2b Classical civilizations declined as a result of internal weaknesses and external invasions...)
    *   **9.3 GROWTH OF REGIONAL CIVILIZATIONS AND INTERREGIONAL INTERACTIONS:** (e.g., 9.3a Major belief systems (Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, Confucianism, Daoism) developed and spread... 9.3b Empires and states emerged, some of which became powerful and influential...)
    *   **9.4 EXPANDING ZONES OF EXCHANGE AND ENCOUNTER:** (e.g., 9.4a Afro-Eurasian trade networks grew... 9.4b The Mongol conquests had significant impacts on societies across Eurasia...)
    *   **9.5 THE EMERGENCE OF A GLOBAL AGE:** (e.g., 9.5a The Renaissance, Reformation, and Scientific Revolution transformed European society... 9.5b European exploration led to the first truly global age and had profound consequences...)
    *   **9.6 TRANSFORMATION OF SOCIETIES (c. 1450 – c. 1750):** (e.g., 9.6a Absolutist states emerged in Europe... 9.6b The Enlightenment challenged traditional beliefs and political structures...)
    *   (Plus relevant Social Studies Practices: Gathering, Using, and Interpreting Evidence; Chronological Reasoning and Causation; Comparison and Contextualization; Geographic Reasoning; Economics and Economic Systems; Civic Participation)
*   **Federal Mandate Considerations (if applicable):** ESSA requirements for a well-rounded education, including history and geography. IDEA principles for UDL.
*   **Statutory Instructional Mandates Integrated (if applicable):** Human Rights issues in historical contexts (e.g., slavery in classical empires, conquest). Development of citizenship concepts and forms of government in different societies. Understanding of diverse cultures and belief systems. Civility and Character Education can be explored through the actions and decisions of historical figures and societies.

## II. Core Concepts / Units (Aligned with NYS Framework for Grade 9 Global History)
(Logically sequenced units or major topics)
*   **Unit 1: Foundations of Human Society: From Foraging to First Civilizations (Prehistory – c. 600 BCE) (Key Idea 9.1)**
    *   Key Concepts: Paleolithic Era (hunter-gatherer societies, tools, art, migration). Neolithic Revolution (domestication of plants and animals, settled agriculture, surplus food, population growth). Characteristics of civilizations (cities, complex institutions - government/religion, specialized labor, record keeping, advanced technology). River valley civilizations (Mesopotamia, Egypt, Indus Valley, Shang China) - geography, achievements, social structures, belief systems.
    *   Learning Objectives (Proposed):
        *   Students will be able to explain the significance of the Neolithic Revolution as a major turning point in human history. (9.1a)
        *   Students will be able to compare the key characteristics and achievements of two early river valley civilizations. (9.1b, 9.1c)
    *   Essential Questions: How did the development of agriculture change human societies? What common features define a "civilization," and how did these first emerge in different parts of the world? How did geography influence the development of early civilizations?
*   **Unit 2: The Classical World: Empires, Ideas, and Connections (c. 600 BCE – c. 600 CE) (Key Idea 9.2)**
    *   Key Concepts: Classical civilizations: Greece (city-states, democracy in Athens, philosophy, art, mythology), Rome (republic to empire, law, engineering, Christianity's rise), Han China (dynastic cycle, Confucianism, Silk Road), Gupta India (Hinduism, Buddhism, achievements in math and science). Common features of classical empires (centralized government, military power, trade networks, cultural achievements). Reasons for decline (internal weaknesses, external invasions).
    *   Learning Objectives (Proposed):
        *   Students will be able to identify and describe key institutions, systems of governance, and cultural achievements of classical Greece and Rome. (9.2a)
        *   Students will be able to analyze the factors that contributed to the decline and fall of the Western Roman Empire and the Han Dynasty. (9.2b)
    *   Essential Questions: What were the major political, social, and cultural contributions of classical civilizations like Greece, Rome, Han China, and Gupta India? What common challenges led to the decline of these powerful empires?
*   **Unit 3: The Post-Classical Era: Growth of Religions, Empires, and Trade Networks (c. 600 CE – c. 1450 CE) (Key Ideas 9.3, 9.4)**
    *   Key Concepts: Rise and spread of major world religions/belief systems (Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, Confucianism, Daoism) and their impact on societies and cultures. Emergence and expansion of empires (e.g., Byzantine Empire, Islamic Caliphates, Tang/Song China, Mongol Empire, West African kingdoms of Ghana/Mali/Songhai, feudal societies in Europe and Japan). Growth of interregional trade networks (Silk Road, Trans-Saharan routes, Indian Ocean maritime system) and their role in cultural diffusion (spread of ideas, technologies, diseases).
    *   Learning Objectives (Proposed):
        *   Students will be able to explain the core beliefs and practices of at least two major world religions that spread during this era and analyze their impact on societies. (9.3a)
        *   Students will be able to describe the political, economic, and social characteristics of a major empire from this period (e.g., Mongol Empire, an Islamic Caliphate). (9.3b)
        *   Students will be able to analyze the causes and effects of expanded interregional trade and interactions, such as the Mongol conquests or the growth of the Silk Road. (9.4a, 9.4b)
    *   Essential Questions: How did major belief systems shape civilizations and interactions between people? What were the characteristics of powerful empires during this era, and how did they influence their regions and beyond? How did increased trade and contact change societies across Afro-Eurasia?
*   **Unit 4: The Dawn of a Global Age: Transformation and Encounter (c. 1400 – c. 1750) (Key Idea 9.5)**
    *   Key Concepts: European Renaissance (humanism, artistic and intellectual achievements). Protestant Reformation and Catholic Counter-Reformation (causes, key figures, impact). Scientific Revolution (new ways of thinking, key figures like Copernicus, Galileo, Newton). Age of Exploration (motivations - God, Gold, Glory; key explorers; technological advancements in navigation). Encounters between hemispheres: Columbian Exchange (transfer of plants, animals, diseases, ideas, people), impact on Native American populations (disease, conquest), development of Atlantic slave trade, rise of European maritime empires (Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, French, English). Mercantilism.
    *   Learning Objectives (Proposed):
        *   Students will be able to explain how the Renaissance, Reformation, and Scientific Revolution transformed European thought and society. (9.5a)
        *   Students will be able to analyze the motivations for European exploration and the short-term and long-term consequences of the Columbian Exchange on both the "Old World" and the "New World." (9.5b, 9.5c)
        *   Students will be able to describe the development and impact of the transatlantic slave trade. (9.5d)
    *   Essential Questions: How did new ideas in Europe challenge traditional ways of thinking and lead to major societal changes? What were the driving forces behind European global exploration? How did the interactions between Europe, Africa, and the Americas reshape the world?
*   **Unit 5: Early Modern Empires and Political Systems (c. 1450 – c. 1750) (Key Idea 9.6 - partially, focuses on global context beyond just Europe)**
    *   Key Concepts: Rise of absolutist monarchies in Europe (e.g., Louis XIV in France). Ottoman Empire (expansion, governance, culture). Mughal Empire in India. Ming/Qing Dynasties in China. Tokugawa Shogunate in Japan (isolation). Comparison of different political systems and assertions of power. Early Enlightenment ideas challenging absolutism (Locke, Montesquieu - seeds for Grade 10).
    *   Learning Objectives (Proposed):
        *   Students will be able to compare the characteristics of absolutist rule in a European state (e.g., France) with the system of governance in a major non-European empire of the same period (e.g., Ottoman Empire or Ming China). (Connects to 9.6a by providing global comparison)
        *   Students will be able to identify early Enlightenment ideas that began to question traditional forms of authority. (9.6b)
    *   Essential Questions: How did different empires and states around the world consolidate and maintain power during the early modern period? How did new ideas begin to challenge established political and social orders?

## III. Instructional Strategies & Resources
*   **Key Pedagogical Approaches:** UDL principles, inquiry-based learning with primary and secondary source analysis (e.g., excerpts from Hammurabi's Code, Confucian Analects, travelers' accounts like Marco Polo or Ibn Battuta, Reformation documents, Enlightenment thinkers), Document-Based Questions (DBQs), historical map analysis (trade routes, empires, exploration routes), timeline creation and analysis, debates on historical interpretations (e.g., impact of Mongols, ethics of colonization), simulations (e.g., Silk Road trade game, feudal manor system), Socratic seminars, comparative analysis of civilizations.
*   **Potential Interdisciplinary Connections:**
    *   **ELA:** Reading world literature, myths, and epics from periods studied (e.g., *Gilgamesh*, *The Odyssey*, excerpts from *The Ramayana* or *Journey to the West*). Writing analytical essays and research reports on historical topics.
    *   **Arts:** Analyzing art, architecture, and music as reflections of cultural values and historical periods (e.g., Greek pottery, Roman architecture, Islamic geometric patterns, Renaissance art).
    *   **Science/Math:** Understanding scientific advancements of different eras (e.g., Mayan astronomy, Islamic contributions to mathematics and medicine, Scientific Revolution discoveries). Geographic calculations, understanding scale on maps.
    *   **World Languages:** Connecting historical developments to the spread and evolution of languages.
*   **Ideas for Supplemental Materials & Technology Integration:** Primary source document readers, historical atlases, world history textbooks, images of artifacts, art, and architecture, documentaries (e.g., "Mankind: The Story of All of Us," "Crash Course World History"), online museum collections (e.g., British Museum, Metropolitan Museum of Art), interactive maps and timelines, virtual tours of historical sites, DBQ Project materials, historical simulations software.

## IV. Assessment Strategies
*   **Formative Assessments:** Quizzes on key terms, figures, events, and geographic locations. Short written responses to document excerpts or historical images. Map quizzes (identifying empires, trade routes, key cities). Participation in class discussions and debates (using rubrics). Exit tickets summarizing key concepts. Graphic organizers comparing civilizations or belief systems.
*   **Summative Assessments:** Document-Based Question (DBQ) essays requiring analysis of multiple sources and construction of a historical argument. Thematic essays comparing civilizations, belief systems, or historical turning points. Research projects on specific civilizations, empires, or historical figures. Presentations (individual or group) on research findings. End-of-unit exams combining multiple-choice, short-answer, and essay questions. Debates with position papers on historical controversies.
*   **Accommodations & Modifications (IDEA/504):** Guided notes or outlines for lectures and readings. Pre-taught vocabulary lists with definitions and visuals. Simplified or excerpted primary source documents. Visual aids (timelines, charts, diagrams of social structures or trade networks). Graphic organizers for planning essays or comparing information. Extended time for assignments and assessments. Choice of topics or formats for research projects.
*   **ELL Support Strategies:** Bilingual glossaries for key historical and geographical terms. Visual timelines and maps with clear labels and color-coding. Sentence frames for historical analysis, argumentation, and comparisons ("One similarity between... and... is...", "This event was a turning point because..."). Pre-teaching of background knowledge before introducing new civilizations or periods. Collaborative group work for document analysis and project development. Using cognates and connecting world history concepts to students' knowledge of their home countries' histories where appropriate.
