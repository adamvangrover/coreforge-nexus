# High School - Participation in Government (Grade 12) - NYS K-12 Social Studies Framework (0.5 Credit)

## I. Overview and Alignment
*   **Subject Description:** Participation in Government is a capstone course, typically taken in Grade 12 for one semester (0.5 credit), designed to equip students with the knowledge, skills, and dispositions for active and informed citizenship in a democratic society. The course focuses on the practical application of citizenship, understanding the structures and functions of government, analyzing public policy, engaging with current events, and participating in democratic processes. Students are encouraged to identify community issues, research policy solutions, and develop civic action plans.
*   **NYS Learning Standards Addressed:**
    *   This course aligns with the **NYS K-12 Social Studies Framework**, particularly **Standard 5: Civics, Citizenship, and Government**. It emphasizes Key Ideas such as:
        *   **12.G1: Foundations of American Democracy:** Understanding the philosophical underpinnings, core principles (e.g., popular sovereignty, rule of law, separation of powers, checks and balances, federalism, individual rights), and historical development of American government.
        *   **12.G2: Civil Rights and Civil Liberties:** Examining the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution and the ongoing efforts to secure and protect these rights for all.
        *   **12.G3: Structures and Functions of Government:** Analyzing the roles and responsibilities of local, state, and national governments, including the legislative, executive, and judicial branches.
        *   **12.G4: Political Participation and Civic Engagement:** Exploring various ways citizens can participate in political processes (e.g., voting, advocacy, community organizing) and influence public policy.
        *   **12.G5: Public Policy:** Understanding how public policy is formulated, implemented, and evaluated, and how citizens can engage in policy debates.
    *   It heavily incorporates **NYS Social Studies Practices**, especially: Gathering, Using, and Interpreting Evidence; Chronological Reasoning and Causation (in understanding policy evolution); Comparison and Contextualization; Geographic Reasoning (in local issues); Economics and Economic Systems (as they relate to policy); and most importantly, **Civic Participation**.
    *   Connections are also made to the **C3 Framework (College, Career, and Civic Life)** dimensions: Developing Questions and Planning Inquiries; Applying Disciplinary Concepts and Tools; Evaluating Sources and Using Evidence; Communicating Conclusions and Taking Informed Action.
*   **Federal Mandate Considerations (if applicable):**
    *   **ESSA (Every Student Succeeds Act):** This course directly supports ESSA's emphasis on providing a "well-rounded education" and promoting "civic engagement and skills."
    *   **IDEA (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act):** UDL principles are foundational. Instruction will ensure accessibility for all students, with accommodations and modifications provided as per IEPs and 504 plans to support full participation in civic discourse and action projects.
*   **Statutory Instructional Mandates Integrated (if applicable):**
    *   **Instruction in Patriotism and Citizenship:** The course is fundamentally about understanding and practicing active citizenship and appreciating democratic values.
    *   **Instruction in the U.S. Constitution, Bill of Rights, and NYS Constitution:** These documents are central to understanding governmental structures and individual rights.
    *   **Civility, Citizenship, and Character Education:** Emphasizes respectful debate, understanding diverse perspectives, and ethical decision-making in civic contexts.
    *   **Instruction Concerning General Elections:** Includes understanding the electoral process, the importance of voting, and how to use sample ballots and become an informed voter.
    *   **Respect for the Flag and Laws:** Fostering an understanding of symbols of democracy and the importance of the rule of law.

## II. Core Concepts / Units
