# High School - Spanish I - NYS Learning Standards for World Languages (LOTE)

## I. Overview and Alignment
*   **Subject Description:** Spanish I is an introductory course designed for students with little or no previous experience in Spanish. The primary goal is to develop novice-level communicative competence in the Spanish language across the three modes of communication: interpretive (listening, reading), interpersonal (interactive speaking, listening, writing), and presentational (speaking, writing). Students will acquire foundational vocabulary, basic grammatical structures, and an appreciation for the diverse cultures of the Spanish-speaking world. This course corresponds to the beginning of Checkpoint A of the NYS Learning Standards for World Languages.
*   **NYS Learning Standards Addressed:** This course is aligned with the **NYS Learning Standards for World Languages (LOTE)**, targeting **Checkpoint A** proficiency levels. The two main standards are:
    *   **Standard 1: Communication:** Students will be able to use a language other than English for communication.
        *   **Interpretive Mode:** Understanding spoken and written Spanish on familiar topics.
        *   **Interpersonal Mode:** Engaging in simple conversations, providing and obtaining information, expressing feelings and emotions, and exchanging opinions.
        *   **Presentational Mode:** Presenting information, concepts, and ideas to an audience of listeners or readers on a variety of topics.
    *   **Standard 2: Cultures:** Students will develop cross-cultural skills and understandings.
        *   Gaining knowledge and understanding of other cultures (products, practices, perspectives of Spanish-speaking communities).
        *   Developing an understanding of the relationship between language and culture.
*   **Federal Mandate Considerations (if applicable):**
    *   **ESSA (Every Student Succeeds Act):** World language study contributes to a "well-rounded education," fostering global awareness and communication skills.
    *   **IDEA (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act):** Instruction will incorporate UDL principles. Accommodations and modifications (e.g., visual supports, scaffolded tasks, use of technology, extended time) will be provided as per IEPs and 504 plans.
    *   **Title VI (Civil Rights Act of 1964):** Instruction will be culturally responsive, promoting respect and understanding for the diversity of Hispanic cultures and ensuring equitable access for all students.
*   **Statutory Instructional Mandates Integrated (if applicable):**
    *   **Civility, Citizenship, and Character Education:** Promoted through discussions on cultural perspectives, respectful communication, and understanding diverse viewpoints within Spanish-speaking communities and in comparison to students' own cultures.

## III. Instructional Strategies & Resources
*   **Key Pedagogical Approaches:**

    *   **Communicative Language Teaching (CLT):** Focus on using language for meaningful communication rather than just grammar drills. Activities simulate real-life situations.
    *   **Total Physical Response (TPR):** Using physical movement to aid language acquisition, especially for commands and action verbs.
    *   **Comprehensible Input (CI):** Teacher uses language that is understandable to students, often supported by visuals, gestures, and context. Storytelling (TPRS) can be incorporated.
    *   **Pair and Small Group Work:** Maximizing student talk time and collaborative learning.
    *   **Role-Playing and Simulations:** Practicing language in realistic scenarios (e.g., ordering food, shopping, meeting someone).
    *   **Games and Songs:** Making learning engaging and memorable.
    *   **Use of Authentic Materials (simplified):** Realia (objects, food packages, clothing), simple illustrated children's books, short authentic video clips (e.g., commercials, simple cartoons), songs with clear lyrics.
*   **Potential Interdisciplinary Connections:**
    *   **Social Studies:** Geography of Spanish-speaking countries (maps, capitals, basic facts), cultural traditions, family structures.
    *   **Music/Art:** Listening to and learning simple Spanish-language songs, exploring visual arts from Hispanic cultures (e.g., recognizing famous artists or styles – very basic).
    *   **English Language Arts:** Cognate awareness, comparing language structures.
    *   **Mathematics:** Numbers, telling time, money/prices.
*   **Ideas for Supplemental Materials & Technology Integration:**
    *   **Textbook and Workbook Series:** Aligned with communicative approach.
    *   **Visuals:** Flashcards (vocabulary, verbs), posters (alphabet, numbers, grammar charts), maps.
    *   **Realia:** Actual objects related to units (food items, clothing, school supplies, household items).
    *   **Audio Resources:** Native speaker recordings for listening comprehension, songs.
    *   **Video Resources:** Short, culturally relevant clips, simple animations, language learning video series.
    *   **Language Learning Apps and Websites:** Duolingo, Quizlet, Kahoot!, Blooket, WordReference.com (dictionary), online practice activities.
    *   **Interactive Whiteboard/Projector:** For displaying visuals, interactive games, video clips.
    *   **Puppets or Props:** For dialogues and storytelling.

## IV. Assessment Strategies
*   **Formative Assessments:**
    *   Active class participation (responding to questions in Spanish, volunteering answers, engaging in pair work).
    *   Completion of homework assignments (workbook exercises, short written tasks, vocabulary practice).
    *   Short quizzes on vocabulary and grammar points.
    *   Listening comprehension activities (e.g., identifying information from a short audio clip).
    *   Simple interpersonal dialogues observed by the teacher.
    *   Exit tickets with targeted phrases or questions.
    *   "Do Now" activities reviewing previous material.
*   **Summative Assessments:**
    *   **Unit Tests:** Incorporating sections on listening comprehension, reading comprehension (simple texts), vocabulary, grammar, and short written responses.
    *   **Interpersonal Speaking Tasks:** Simulated conversations with the teacher or a partner on unit themes (e.g., introductions, making plans, ordering food).
    *   **Presentational Speaking Tasks:** Short individual presentations (e.g., describing a family member, talking about their favorite foods or hobbies, showing and describing clothing).
    *   **Presentational Writing Tasks:** Writing simple paragraphs or short dialogues related to unit themes (e.g., describing their school day, writing a postcard).
    *   **Projects (simple):** Creating a visual family tree with descriptions, designing a menu for a café, creating a short video introducing themselves and their likes.
    *   **Portfolio:** Collection of student work throughout the year showing progress.
*   **Accommodations & Modifications (IDEA/504):**
    *   Provide extensive visual aids (pictures, gestures, realia) for vocabulary and concepts.
    *   Offer sentence starters or frames for speaking and writing tasks.
    *   Create graphic organizers for grammar concepts (e.g., verb conjugation charts, noun-adjective agreement).
    *   Extended time for assessments and assignments as per IEP/504.
    *   Preferential seating for optimal listening and visual access.
    *   Allow use of personal vocabulary lists or teacher-provided notes for some tasks.
    *   Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps.
    *   Offer alternative assessment formats (e.g., oral response instead of written for some grammar points, drawing to show comprehension).
*   **ELL Support Strategies (for students learning Spanish as a third language, or for Spanish-speaking heritage learners needing literacy support in Spanish):**
    *   **For non-Spanish speakers (learning Spanish as L3+):** Explicit instruction in Spanish phonetics and sound-symbol correspondence. Leverage cognate awareness from English (and other known languages). Peer tutoring with more advanced students.
    *   **For heritage learners (students with home background in Spanish but varying literacy levels):** Focus on formal grammar structures, standard orthography (spelling, accents), differentiating registers (formal vs. informal, home language vs. academic language). Build academic vocabulary in Spanish. Validate home language use while teaching standard forms. Use materials that reflect diverse Hispanic cultures, including their own.
    *   **General Strategies:** Create a low-anxiety classroom environment where mistakes are seen as part of learning. Use culturally responsive and representative materials. Provide opportunities for students to share personal connections to the language or culture.
