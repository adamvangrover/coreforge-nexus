*   **ELL Support Strategies (for students learning Spanish as a third language, or for Spanish-speaking heritage learners needing literacy support):**
    *   For non-Spanish speakers: Explicit instruction in phonetics, cognate awareness, peer tutoring.
    *   For heritage learners: Focus on formal grammar, orthography, register differences, building academic vocabulary, validating home language use while teaching standard forms.
    *   General: Culturally responsive materials that reflect diverse Hispanic cultures, opportunities to share personal connections to the language or culture.
