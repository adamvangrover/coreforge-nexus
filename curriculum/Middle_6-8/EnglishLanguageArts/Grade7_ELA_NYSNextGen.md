**Note: The content herein is a proposed draft for Subject Matter Expert (SME) review and expansion.**

## I. Overview and Alignment
*   **Subject Description:** Grade 7 ELA builds on foundational skills to deepen students' abilities in analyzing complex literary and informational texts, constructing well-supported arguments, conducting research projects, and refining communication skills in writing, speaking, and listening. Students engage with a diverse range of texts and media.
*   **NYS Learning Standards Addressed:** (Illustrative examples)
    *   **Reading Standards for Literature (RL):** 7R1 (Cite several pieces of textual evidence to support analysis of what the text says explicitly as well as inferences drawn from the text.), 7R2 (Determine a theme or central idea of a text and analyze its development over the course of the text; provide an objective summary.), 7R3 (Analyze how particular elements of a story or drama interact).
    *   **Reading Standards for Informational Text (RI):** 7R1 (Cite several pieces of textual evidence to support analysis of what the text says explicitly as well as inferences drawn from the text.), 7R5 (Analyze the structure an author uses to organize a text, including how the major sections contribute to the whole and to the development of the ideas.), 7R8 (Trace and evaluate the argument and specific claims in a text, assessing whether the reasoning is sound and the evidence is relevant and sufficient to support the claims).
    *   **Writing Standards (W):** 7W1 (Write arguments to support claims with clear reasons and relevant evidence.), 7W2 (Write informative/explanatory texts to examine a topic and convey complex ideas, concepts, and information through the selection, organization, and analysis of content.), 7W4 (Produce clear and coherent writing in which the development, organization, and style are appropriate to task, purpose, and audience).

    *   **Language Standards (L):** 7L1 (Demonstrate command of the conventions of standard English grammar and usage when writing or speaking.), 7L4 (Determine or clarify the meaning of unknown and multiple-meaning words and phrases based on grade 7 reading and content, choosing flexibly from a range of strategies).
*   **Federal Mandate Considerations (if applicable):** ESSA's emphasis on a well-rounded education, including literacy across content areas. IDEA principles for UDL to ensure accessibility.
*   **Statutory Instructional Mandates Integrated (if applicable):** Civility, Character Education, and Human Rights themes can be explored through text selections and discussions, promoting respectful dialogue and understanding of diverse perspectives.

## II. Core Concepts / Units
(Logically sequenced units or major topics)
*   **Unit 1: The Art of Storytelling: Analyzing Narrative Elements and Author's Craft**
    *   Key Concepts: Plot development (exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, resolution), characterization (direct and indirect), setting, theme, point of view (first person, third person limited/omniscient), conflict (internal/external), foreshadowing, flashback, irony, symbolism, author's word choice and tone.
    *   Learning Objectives (Proposed):
        *   Students will be able to identify and analyze how character, setting, and plot interact to develop the theme of a literary text. (Combines 7R2, 7R3)
        *   Students will be able to cite multiple pieces of textual evidence to support inferences about a character's motivations or traits. (7R1)
        *   Students will be able to analyze how an author’s choices regarding figurative language (e.g., metaphor, simile, personification) contribute to the overall meaning and tone of a narrative. (7R4 focus)
    *   Essential Questions: How do authors create believable characters and engaging plots? How do literary devices enhance a story's meaning and impact? What can we learn about ourselves and the world through stories?
*   **Unit 2: Unpacking Arguments: Evaluating Claims, Reasoning, and Evidence**
    *   Key Concepts: Identifying an author's main claim/argument, supporting claims/reasons, types of evidence (facts, statistics, expert testimony, anecdotes), evaluating the relevance and sufficiency of evidence, recognizing sound vs. unsound reasoning (e.g., logical fallacies - basic introduction), identifying bias and perspective in informational texts and media.
    *   Learning Objectives (Proposed):
        *   Students will be able to trace the main argument and supporting claims in an informational text. (7R8)
        *   Students will be able to evaluate whether the evidence provided in a text is relevant and sufficient to support the author's claims. (7R8)
        *   Students will be able to write a paragraph summarizing an author's argument and stating whether they find it convincing, providing one reason. (Connects to 7W1)
    *   Essential Questions: What makes an argument strong or weak? How can we tell if information is trustworthy and evidence is reliable? How do authors try to persuade their audience?
*   **Unit 3: Inquiry and Investigation: Conducting Research and Crafting Informative Texts**
    *   Key Concepts: Formulating focused research questions, identifying credible sources (print and digital), gathering relevant information, paraphrasing and summarizing information to avoid plagiarism, organizing information logically, writing informative/explanatory texts with a clear central idea, supporting details, and appropriate transitions. Citing sources (basic introduction to method).
    *   Learning Objectives (Proposed):
        *   Students will be able to develop a research question and locate at least three credible sources of information on a given topic. (Connects to 7W2, 7W5)
        *   Students will be able to synthesize information from multiple sources to write an informative paragraph that answers their research question. (7W2, 7W6)
        *   Students will be able to use appropriate formatting (e.g., headings, graphics if applicable) and language to present information clearly. (7W4)
    *   Essential Questions: How do we ask good questions to guide our research? How can we find reliable information and use it responsibly? How can we effectively share what we have learned with others?
*   **Unit 4: The Power of Language: Vocabulary, Grammar, and Style**
    *   Key Concepts: Using context clues, word parts (prefixes, suffixes, roots), and reference materials to determine word meanings. Understanding shades of meaning among related words. Applying conventions of standard English grammar (e.g., subject-verb agreement, pronoun-antecedent agreement, correct use of phrases and clauses, varied sentence structures) and usage in writing and speaking. Using punctuation (commas, semicolons, colons - basic) and capitalization correctly.
    *   Learning Objectives (Proposed):
        *   Students will be able to use context clues and knowledge of Greek/Latin affixes and roots to determine the meaning of unfamiliar words. (7L4a,b)
        *   Students will be able to identify and correct errors in subject-verb agreement and pronoun usage in their own and others' writing. (7L1a,b,c)
        *   Students will be able to combine simple sentences into more complex sentences using conjunctions, phrases, and clauses to enhance clarity and style. (7L1c, 7L3a)
    *   Essential Questions: How does knowing more words help us understand and express ideas better? How can using grammar correctly make our writing and speaking clearer and more effective? How can we make our writing style more engaging?
*   **Unit 5: Voices in Dialogue: Collaborative Discussions and Effective Presentations**
    *   Key Concepts: Preparing for discussions by reading/researching, posing and responding to questions thoughtfully, building on others' ideas, summarizing points of agreement/disagreement, using evidence to support contributions. Planning and delivering focused oral presentations with clear main points, supporting details, and appropriate eye contact, volume, and pacing. Using visual aids effectively.
    *   Learning Objectives (Proposed):
        *   Students will be able to participate actively and respectfully in a collaborative discussion, contributing relevant ideas and evidence. (7SL1)
        *   Students will be able to deliver a short, organized oral presentation on a familiar topic, using clear language and supporting details. (7SL4)
    *   Essential Questions: How can we learn from each other through discussion? What makes a presentation engaging and informative? How can we respectfully disagree with others' ideas?

## III. Instructional Strategies & Resources
*   **Key Pedagogical Approaches:** UDL principles, close reading and annotation strategies, Socratic seminars, literature circles, writer's workshop models (mini-lessons, drafting, revising, editing, conferring), peer review protocols, debates, fishbowl discussions, reciprocal teaching, project-based learning (e.g., creating a class anthology, developing a multimedia presentation on a research topic).
*   **Potential Interdisciplinary Connections:** Researching historical events or figures for informational texts (Social Studies - 7.1-7.9), analyzing scientific articles for structure and argument (Science - MS-ETS1-3), writing explanations of mathematical problem-solving processes (Math), exploring themes of social justice or cultural identity that connect across subjects.
*   **Ideas for Supplemental Materials & Technology Integration:** Diverse range of novels, short stories, poems, plays, myths, legends, biographies, articles, essays, speeches. Online databases for research (e.g., school library databases, Newsela, CommonLit), word processing software, presentation software (PowerPoint, Google Slides), collaborative document tools (Google Docs), online discussion forums, digital portfolio platforms, grammar and vocabulary practice websites/apps (e.g., NoRedInk, Quill.org, Membean - for review).

## IV. Assessment Strategies
*   **Formative Assessments:** Reading response journals/logs, exit tickets with key concept checks, participation in class and small group discussions (using rubrics or checklists), drafts of essays with teacher/peer feedback, outlines for research papers or presentations, quick-writes, quizzes on vocabulary, grammar, or literary terms, think-pair-share activities.
*   **Summative Assessments:** Analytical essays on literary texts, argumentative essays on debatable topics, research reports or multimedia presentations, narrative writing pieces, oral presentations with visual aids, debates with prepared arguments, end-of-unit tests incorporating text analysis and application of skills.
*   **Accommodations & Modifications (IDEA/504):** Graphic organizers for planning writing or analyzing texts (e.g., plot diagrams, argument maps), sentence starters or frames for essays and discussions, audio versions of texts, text-to-speech software, speech-to-text software for writing, chunking of longer assignments, extended time for tasks and assessments, choice of texts or topics for projects (within parameters), pre-teaching of key vocabulary and concepts.
*   **ELL Support Strategies:** Pre-teaching of essential vocabulary with visual aids and cognate connections, providing background knowledge for texts, use of bilingual glossaries or dictionaries, sentence frames for academic language and discussions, scaffolded reading guides with comprehension questions, opportunities for oral rehearsal before speaking tasks, pairing with supportive English-proficient peers, using texts with clear structures and familiar themes where possible.
