## III. Instructional Strategies & Resources
*   **Key Pedagogical Approaches:** UDL principles, inquiry-based learning, collaborative problem-solving, use of graphing technology (calculators, Desmos, GeoGebra), hands-on activities with geometric shapes and transformations (e.g., patty paper, miras, coordinate grids), real-world problem scenarios and data sets, math talks, error analysis, direct instruction balanced with student exploration.
*   **Potential Interdisciplinary Connections:** Using functions to model scientific data or relationships (Science - MS-PS3-1, MS-LS1-5), calculating distances or scale on maps (Social Studies), designing 3D models and understanding transformations (Art/Technology - MS-ETS1-4), analyzing statistical trends in health or social issues (Health/Social Studies).
*   **Ideas for Supplemental Materials & Technology Integration:** Graphing calculators, dynamic geometry software (GeoGebra), online graphing tools (Desmos), applets for transformations and functions, measurement tools (rulers, protractors), coordinate grids, algebra tiles (for expressions/equations), real-world data sources (e.g., sports statistics, census data), interactive whiteboard activities.

## IV. Assessment Strategies
*   **Formative Assessments:** Exit tickets with concept checks, homework problems (procedural and conceptual), class participation in discussions and problem-solving, whiteboarding solutions, short quizzes on specific skills (e.g., solving equations, applying exponent rules, identifying function properties), observation of student work during activities.
*   **Summative Assessments:** Unit tests with a mix of multiple-choice, short-answer, and extended-response questions applying concepts and procedures. Projects involving modeling with functions, geometric design and transformations, or statistical investigation of bivariate data. Presentations of solutions to complex problems or project findings. Performance tasks requiring application of multiple concepts.
*   **Accommodations & Modifications (IDEA/504):** Formula sheets for geometry, properties lists for exponents/equations. Graphing calculators or software for visualization. Step-by-step examples and guided notes. Visual aids for geometric concepts and transformations. Reduced number of problems for practice, extended time. Use of graph paper for organizing work and graphing. Breaking down multi-step problems.
*   **ELL Support Strategies:** Visual dictionaries for math vocabulary (e.g., "slope," "intercept," "dilation"). Sentence frames for explaining mathematical reasoning ("The slope is... because..."). Bilingual glossaries. Use of manipulatives (e.g., algebra tiles, geometric solids) to demonstrate concepts. Peer collaboration and think-pair-share. Explicit instruction in interpreting word problems and mathematical notation. Connecting abstract concepts to real-world examples from students' experiences.
