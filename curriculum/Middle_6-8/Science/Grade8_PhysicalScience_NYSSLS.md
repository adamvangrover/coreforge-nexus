**Note: The content herein is a proposed draft for Subject Matter Expert (SME) review and expansion.**

## I. Overview and Alignment
*   **Subject Description:** Grade 8 Physical Science delves into fundamental concepts of chemistry and physics. Students explore the nature of matter and its interactions, forces and motion, energy transformations, and wave properties. The course emphasizes developing scientific inquiry skills, using models, analyzing data, and applying concepts to real-world phenomena and engineering design challenges.
*   **NYS Learning Standards Addressed:** (Performance Expectations examples from Middle School Physical Science - MS-PS)
    *   **MS-PS1: Matter and Its Interactions:** MS-PS1-1 (Develop models to describe the atomic composition of simple molecules and extended structures), MS-PS1-2 (Analyze and interpret data on the properties of substances before and after the substances interact to determine if a chemical reaction has occurred), MS-PS1-4 (Develop a model that predicts and describes changes in particle motion, temperature, and state of a pure substance when thermal energy is added or removed), MS-PS1-5 (Develop and use a model to describe how the total number of atoms does not change in a chemical reaction and thus mass is conserved).
    *   **MS-PS2: Motion and Stability: Forces and Interactions:** MS-PS2-1 (Apply Newton’s Third Law to design a solution to a problem involving the motion of two colliding objects), MS-PS2-2 (Plan an investigation to provide evidence that the change in an object’s motion depends on the sum of the forces on the object and the mass of the object), MS-PS2-3 (Ask questions about data to determine the factors that affect the strength of electric and magnetic forces).

*   **Statutory Instructional Mandates Integrated (if applicable):** Fire and Arson Prevention concepts can be linked to discussions of chemical reactions (combustion) and energy transfer. Safety in handling materials and conducting experiments is paramount.

## II. Core Concepts / Units (Aligned with NYSSLS Middle School Physical Science PEs)
(Logically sequenced units or major topics)
*   **Unit 1: The Nature of Matter: Atoms, Molecules, and States (MS-PS1)**
    *   Key Concepts: Atomic structure (protons, neutrons, electrons - simplified model), elements, molecules, compounds, pure substances vs. mixtures. States of matter (solid, liquid, gas) in terms of particle motion and arrangement. Phase changes (melting, freezing, boiling, condensation) and thermal energy. Density as a property of matter.
    *   Learning Objectives (Proposed):
        *   Students will be able to develop a model to show that atoms combine to form molecules of different substances. (correlates with MS-PS1-1)
        *   Students will be able to develop a model to describe how adding or removing thermal energy affects the motion and arrangement of particles in a substance, leading to changes in state. (correlates with MS-PS1-4)
    *   Essential Questions: What is everything around us made of? How do particles behave in solids, liquids, and gases? How does heat affect matter?
*   **Unit 2: Chemical Interactions: Reactions and Conservation (MS-PS1)**
    *   Key Concepts: Physical vs. chemical changes. Evidence of chemical reactions (color change, gas production, precipitate formation, temperature change). Reactants and products. The law of conservation of mass: atoms are rearranged in chemical reactions, but the total number of atoms (and thus mass) remains the same. Simple chemical equations (conceptual understanding).
    *   Learning Objectives (Proposed):
        *   Students will be able to analyze and interpret data from experiments to determine if a chemical reaction has occurred based on observed property changes. (correlates with MS-PS1-2)
        *   Students will be able to develop and use a model (e.g., drawings, physical models with building blocks) to demonstrate that in a chemical reaction, atoms are rearranged to form new substances, but the total number of atoms is conserved. (correlates with MS-PS1-5)
    *   Essential Questions: How can we tell if a new substance has been formed? What happens to atoms during a chemical reaction? Why doesn't matter disappear in a chemical reaction?
*   **Unit 3: Forces, Motion, and Interactions (MS-PS2)**
    *   Key Concepts: Types of forces (gravity, friction, applied, magnetic, electric - introductory). Balanced and unbalanced forces and their effect on motion (Newton's First Law conceptualized). Relationship between force, mass, and acceleration (Newton's Second Law conceptualized - greater force or less mass means greater change in motion). Newton's Third Law (for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction). Factors affecting gravitational force (mass, distance). Factors affecting magnetic and electric forces.
    *   Learning Objectives (Proposed):
        *   Students will be able to plan and conduct an investigation to provide evidence that an object's change in motion is dependent on the sum of the forces acting on it and its mass. (correlates with MS-PS2-2)
        *   Students will be able to apply Newton’s Third Law to explain the motion of two colliding objects (e.g., when one object exerts a force on a second object, the second object exerts an equal and opposite force on the first object). (correlates with MS-PS2-1)
        *   Students will be able to ask questions and investigate factors that affect the strength of magnetic or electric forces. (correlates with MS-PS2-3)
    *   Essential Questions: What makes objects start moving, stop moving, or change direction? How do forces always come in pairs? What makes magnets and static electricity work?
*   **Unit 4: Energy: Forms, Transformations, and Conservation (MS-PS3)**
    *   Key Concepts: Forms of energy (kinetic, potential - gravitational and elastic, thermal, chemical, light, sound, electrical). Energy transformation (e.g., chemical to thermal in burning, electrical to light in a bulb). Energy transfer (conduction, convection, radiation). Relationship between kinetic energy, mass, and speed. Relationship between potential energy and position/arrangement. Conservation of energy (energy is not created or destroyed, only transformed or transferred - conceptual). Temperature as a measure of average kinetic energy of particles.
    *   Learning Objectives (Proposed):
        *   Students will be able to construct and interpret graphs to show the relationship between an object's kinetic energy and its mass and speed. (correlates with MS-PS3-1)
        *   Students will be able to develop a model to describe how the potential energy stored in a system changes when the arrangement of objects interacting at a distance (e.g., objects in a gravitational field, magnets) changes. (correlates with MS-PS3-2)
        *   Students will be able to plan an investigation to determine how factors like the type of matter, mass, and energy transferred affect the change in temperature of a sample. (correlates with MS-PS3-4)
    *   Essential Questions: What is energy and what are its different forms? How does energy change from one form to another? Where does energy go when it seems to disappear?
*   **Unit 5: Waves: Properties and Information Transfer (MS-PS4)**
    *   Key Concepts: Waves as a disturbance that transfers energy. Properties of waves: amplitude, wavelength, frequency. Relationship between wave properties (e.g., wavelength and frequency). Mechanical waves (require a medium - e.g., sound, water waves) vs. electromagnetic waves (can travel through vacuum - e.g., light). How waves interact with materials: reflection, absorption, transmission. Light waves and their properties (color, sight). Sound waves and their properties (pitch, loudness, hearing). Using waves for information transfer (e.g., digital signals, cell phones - basic concept).
    *   Learning Objectives (Proposed):
        *   Students will be able to use a mathematical representation (e.g., simple equation like speed = wavelength x frequency, or graphical models) to describe how wave properties like amplitude relate to energy. (correlates with MS-PS4-1)
        *   Students will be able to develop and use a model (e.g., diagrams, ray drawings) to describe how waves are reflected, absorbed, or transmitted when they encounter different materials. (correlates with MS-PS4-2)
    *   Essential Questions: What are waves and how do they carry energy? How are light and sound similar and different as waves? How do we use waves to communicate information?

## III. Instructional Strategies & Resources

## IV. Assessment Strategies
*   **Formative Assessments:** Lab reports/notebooks (with sections for hypothesis, procedure, data, analysis, conclusion), exit tickets with concept checks, concept maps, class discussions and Q&A, pre-lab quizzes, teacher observation of experimental skills and collaboration, peer review of designs or explanations, CER responses to prompts.
*   **Summative Assessments:** Unit tests with multiple-choice, short-answer, and problem-solving questions (conceptual and application-based). Performance-based lab assessments where students design and conduct an investigation or solve an engineering problem. Projects involving research and presentation on applications of physical science concepts (e.g., renewable energy technologies, communication technologies). Building and testing a model or device.
*   **Accommodations & Modifications (IDEA/504):** Visual instructions and checklists for labs. Pre-filled data tables or lab sheets. Use of calculators for calculations. Formula sheets (if applicable). Scaffolded questions for analysis and conclusion. Choice of project topics or presentation formats. Extended time for tasks and assessments. Breaking down complex investigations into smaller parts.
*   **ELL Support Strategies:** Bilingual glossaries for scientific terms. Visual aids (diagrams, animations, realia) for abstract concepts. Hands-on activities that allow for demonstration of understanding with minimal language demands. Sentence frames for writing lab reports, explanations, and arguments ("My hypothesis is...", "The data shows that...", "This happens because..."). Collaborative grouping with supportive peers.
